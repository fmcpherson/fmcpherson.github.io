Does anyone have a recommendation on a case for the iPad Pro 10.5? I prefer a case that doesn't add bulk, is easy to take on/off, and has a place for the Apple Pencil. I like the look of [the Pad & Quill Oxford case](https://www.padandquill.com/cases-for-ipad/oxford-leather-ipad-pro-105-case.html), but I am uncertain about the adhesive tape and how easy it is to take the case off.
