[Charles P. Pierce](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a22700465/charlottesville-anniversary-race-america/):
>Indians extirpated. Slavery. The burning of convents in Boston. Red Scares. Blacklists. Lynching. Charlottesville.

>All of these were perpetrated by people who, by any measure you can imagine, were more free than any other people who'd ever lived. That's the virus working. I am so free that I insist that my freedom includes the freedom to deny you yours.
