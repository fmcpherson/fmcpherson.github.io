[Barbara O'Brien](https://rethinkingreligion-book.info/the-latter-day-dimwits-of-televised-religion/):
>Television producers booked one right-wing religious figure after another, all taking the side of Terri Schiavo’s parents, as if “religion” spoke with one voice on this issue. 

Unfortunately, many assume that how they see Christianity represented by talking heads on TV defines Christianity. One of the biggest mistakes made about religion is thinking that there is one voice on Christian thought, which is why government decisions based on Christian ethics conflicts with the first amendment.
