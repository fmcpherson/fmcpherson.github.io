I haven't seen much written about this, but [it looks to me like Siri Shortcuts is the new Workflow](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/211/). Will Workflow as we now know it go away to be replaced by the Siri Shortcuts app? It's ironic that Apple aquired an app, Workflow, to make another app it aquired, Siri, more useful.
