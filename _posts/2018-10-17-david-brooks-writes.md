[David Brooks writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/politics-race-white-tribalism.html) of the [Hidden Tribes](https://hiddentribes.us/) survey and seems to conclude that our problem is a white civil war between Progressive Activitists and Devoted Conservatives.

When I scroll down through the results, I am not so convinced, particularly when I read this definition of The Politically Disengaged, which made up 26 percent of the participants.

>The Politically Disengaged (26 percent of the population) are untrusting, suspicious about external threats, conspiratorially minded, and pessimistic about progress. They tend to be patriotic yet detached from politics
