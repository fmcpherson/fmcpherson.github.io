I thought this weekend I had my first fatality due to [upgrading my Pixel 2 to Android P](https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/07/26/ive-been-running.html). The Starbucks app on my phone lost my login information and I couldn't get it to signin. It took me a day to contemplate the issue before I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app, which fixed the problem.
