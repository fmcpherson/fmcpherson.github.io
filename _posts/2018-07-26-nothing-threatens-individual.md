>Nothing threatens individual freedom and the meaning of life like war, poverty, terror. But there are also indirect and only slightly more remote dangers. One of these is the stupefaction of man . . . by mass culture with its intentional or commercially motivated lowering of intellectual level and content, with its stress on entertainment or utilitarianism, and with its carefully protective censorship. -- [Andrei Sakharov](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fifty-years-later-andrei-sakharovs-most-famous-essay-is-a-powerful-model-of-writing-for-social-change)

The New Yorker article I link to above that includes the quote above is very good, recommended.
