I've [ported a blog post I wrote in 2014 using Fargo to the site I am setting up](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/stories/2018/06/30/my-internet-writing-story.html) using Jekyll and Netlify. The post is an historical account, current at that time, of the tools I used to write and host content on the web. I've been blogging since 1999, which means I am approaching 20 years of blogging. 

Unfortunately, not all of my early content, almost 8 years worth, is accessible due to how that content was stored. However, there is access to the last decade worth of my writing, some of it good, most of it meh. I've [pointed to the sites hosting those last 7 years](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/about/).
