A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center
Ilia Delio, 

> When we say, “Jesus is the Christ,” we are saying that the humanity of Jesus is one with divinity, the “mystery hidden from the beginning of the world.”   There is a particularity here, a _haecceitas_ (or thisness) that cannot be overlooked.   Jesus _is _the Christ which means all that God is, is given to us in Jesus, rendering a new understanding of God as relational, self-communicative, self-emptying.
