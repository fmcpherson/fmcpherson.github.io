I am not excited by subtle UI design changes such as being shown by [the Android P developer preview](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/hands-on-with-android-p-is-this-the-beginning-of-a-new-design-language/). What I am more interested in is substantial changes, which frankly have been few and far between in Android and iOS. I bought a Pixel 2 last year only because I knew with the release of Android O the Nexus 6P had reached the end of the line and would get no more updates. Otherwise, the 6P was and still is a great phone.
