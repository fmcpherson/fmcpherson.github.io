It's the beginning of the year and therefore the time for my yearly ritual of trying to find a to-do (task management) app that I like and think that I will use. I am again finding myself with [Toodledo](http://www.toodledo.com), mostly because it has more filtering features that other apps and because it has a robust web app. However, Toodledo does not have a robust iOS app. 

The Toodledo iOS app does the job but doesn't have the best UI. However, I have found that 2Do syns with Toodledo so I am giving that a try. At worst I can toggle between the two apps because they sync with the same data. 

Unfortunately, 2Do does not sync Toodledo's statuses, so if I want the same functionality I need to create tags rather that statuses.
