I am curious to know whether [the new web messenging feature of Android Messages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-android-messages-for-web-is-here-this-is-how-it-lets-you-text-from-pcs-macs) will work in a browser on an iPad. I've been using Pushbullet for this type of remote texting, and that works well from an Android tablet or Windows PC, but the iOS version of Pushbullet does not support SMS.
