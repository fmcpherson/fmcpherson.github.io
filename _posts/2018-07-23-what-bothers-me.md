What bothers me more is the number of people who find [the president's behavior](https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1021334339399843840) acceptable. We have a huge disconnect in what is acceptable competency of a U.S. President. I want a person who can kill thousands on my behalf to be competent. For too many competency was not at all important in deciding between Clinton and Trump.
