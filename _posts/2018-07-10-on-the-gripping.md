On the gripping hand, in a year the price of [the Surface Go](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-go-specs-price) may become low enough to make it a worthwhile replacement of my Surface 3. The Surface 3 is my only personally-owned Windows 10 machine.

For me, the main problem with the Go is its price, I think Microsoft either needs to bundle the keyboard or drop the price down at least $100. What makes the Go appealing is the built-in kickstand and mouse support, both of which are things I miss using the iPad Pro.
