I've continued to see [the problem with my Fossil Q Explorist smartwatch](http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/recent-changes/view/fossil-q-explorist) that appeared after installing the H update to Android Wear. Today I found a recommendation to turn off Mobile Battery Saver and so far since I have done that I have not seen the problem.

*Update: Alas, turnign off Mobile Battery Saver wasn't the fix, the problem reoccurred. Next step is to turn off the always on display. I've also sent a message to Fossil to see if they can tell me how to downgrade.*
