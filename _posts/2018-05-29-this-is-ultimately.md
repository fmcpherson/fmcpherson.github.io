“This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.”

[The Bill Gates Line](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/)

Do all platforms ultimately end up being commoditized? I see companies like Google and Facebook striving to not be like the personal computer or Windows, so I suspect they choose to be aggregators to protect themselves.
