[Google has formally released Android 9](https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-9-pie/), which will informally be known as Android Pie (P is for Pie). The nanny, otherwise known as [Digital Wellbeing](https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/), will launch in the fall. I am not surprised by the release as the beta I have been running has been very stable.
