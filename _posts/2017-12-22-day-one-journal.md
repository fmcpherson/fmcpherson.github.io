[Day One Journal](https://dayoneapp.com/) is now available for Android, and now I have a decision to make. Before Day One changed to a yearly subscription, I had purchased a version and therfore I am grandfathered in a plan that enables me to sync across iOS devices, but that will not support Android. So, is it worth $25 per year to have access to my journal from my Android smartphone?
