If we can't agree that there are things humans should not do to other humans, particularly to those who are vulnerable, then we have a problem and that is being exposed in the United States' [current practice of separating children from families](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/how-the-trump-administration-is-defending-its-indefensible-child-separation-policy.html). From the time that Trump seriously started running for president we have seen a widening gulf between those who care about what we do to one another and those who do not.
