Ed Bott has updated [an article he wrote](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-goes-all-in-with-android-apps-for-business/) about the Microsoft apps that run on Android. What is even more interesting is how well these apps will run on Chromebooks that have the Google Play store, which is why I am planning to buy a new Chromebook this year.
