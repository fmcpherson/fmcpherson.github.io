[Surface Go review: The ideal cheap Windows tablet... almost](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/02/surface-go-review/)

I bought the Surface 3 because of its support for an active digitizer. Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad. 

Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don't really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.
