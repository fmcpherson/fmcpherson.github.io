I am a long time user of Evernote, my first note was created in March 2008, but I have experience with that the original Windows app [described in this article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90216018/inside-evernotes-brain). My main attraction to Evernote has been how its purpose aligns to how I view personal computing.
