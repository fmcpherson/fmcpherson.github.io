Looks like [there is a way to run Windows apps on Chromebooks](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/15/crossover-chrome-os-adds-support-quicken-2018-chromeboxes/). I've written about my plans to buy a new Chromebook that will support the Google Play store and Linux apps, so I expect I could run Windows apps using this method. However, I can't think of a Windows app that I will really need.
