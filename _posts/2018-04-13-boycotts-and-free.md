What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising. 

If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don't see how in any way that infringes on a person's free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person's ability to make money on cable TV. 

Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being "fair and balanced" is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.
