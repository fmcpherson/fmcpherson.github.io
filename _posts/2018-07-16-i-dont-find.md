I don't find it [shocking](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-press-conference/index.html) that Trump has a very favorable view towards Putin and Russia. Russia is about the only place that will give Trump a loan. Putin has not personally offended Trump in any way, and Trump likely does admire what Putin has. 

All Putin has to do is continue stroking Trump's ego.
