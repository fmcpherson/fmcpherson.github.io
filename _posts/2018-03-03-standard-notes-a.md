[Standard Notes A Simple And Private Notes App](https://standardnotes.org/)

I am invested in [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), but if I we're starting a fresh search for a note taking repository, I would probably go with Standard Notes. The most appealing feature is that it encrypts all notes before they are stored locally, and the encrypted copy is what is synced to their server. 

Standard Noted runs on multiple platforms, and the paid version is very extensible and supports two factor authentication. If you are inclined, you can host Standard Noted on your own server.
