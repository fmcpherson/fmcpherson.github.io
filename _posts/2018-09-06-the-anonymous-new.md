[The anonymous New York Times Trump op-ed tells us what we already knew: Trump is unfit](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/6/17825406/trump-woodward-op-ed-nyt-anonymous-impeachment)

> The Founding Fathers were not unaware of the possibility that a demagogue or a knave might win the presidency. That’s why they checked the executive with an independent Congress and built in powers of impeachment. That Republicans in this Congress have proven so subservient to — or scared of — Trump that they have let the fate of the country hinge on whether his staff can adequately distract and calm him is a subversion of the constitutional order and an abdication of responsibility.
