Back in the day before Gmail I used to run my own email server in my house. It was a bit of a pain to maintain, but it satisfied the geek in me. There is a company that is selling [an IoT-like email server](https://thehelm.com/pages/product) that costs $500. I've never heard of the company and therefore can't vouch for it, but I find the appliance intriguing. Just found [an article on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/10/meet-helm-the-startup-taking-on-gmail-with-a-server-that-runs-in-your-home/) about this product. 

The solution, called Helm, sounds a lot like [Pogoplug](https://twitter.com/pogoplug?lang=en), which was a personal cloud storage device that is no longer available. The risk of using a product from a small company that might not stay in business to store and access personal data is something one has to take in to consideration. 

Out of curiosity, I looked for the oldest message in my Gmail archive, its from when I first got an account in May, 2004.
