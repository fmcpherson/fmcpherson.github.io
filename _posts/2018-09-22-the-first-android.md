[The first Android phone was an ugly thing, and I loved it - CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-first-android-phone-was-an-ugly-thing-and-i-loved-it/)

It was not my first smartphone, but I was a proud owner of the T-Mobile G1, the first Google phone. For me the G1 was more about the Google experience than the hardware. I've always felt that Google's Internet first, information first approach aligned better to my needs than Apple's end user experience first, hardware design first approach.
