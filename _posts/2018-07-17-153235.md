When I first saw the title of this book, [How to Think](http://howtothinkbook.com/), my reaction was, "do we really need to teach people how to think?" Then I thought, yes, yes we do! More thinking and less reacting is needed. 

From the author: 
>"Eventually two points occurred to me. The first is that many of our fiercest disputes occur because the people involved simply aren’t thinking: they’re reacting or emoting or virtue-signaling or ingroup-identifying. The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think."
