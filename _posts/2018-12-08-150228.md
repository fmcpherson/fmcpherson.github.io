A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center
Ilia Delio, 

> Christ is the communion of divine personal love expressed in every created form of reality—every star, leaf, bird, fish, tree, rabbit and every human person. Everything is christified because everything expresses divine love incarnate.  However, Jesus Christ is the “thisness” of God (‘God is like this and this is God’) so what Jesus is by nature everything else is by grace (divine love).   We are not God but every single person is born out of the love of God, expresses this love in his/her unique personal form and has the capacity to be united with God.  It is for this reason that the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure described the mystery of Jesus Christ as a coincidence of opposites.  Because Jesus _is _the Christ, every human is already reconciled with every other human in the mystery of divine so that Christ is more than Jesus alone; Christ is the whole reality bound in a union of love.
