[Android P will reportedly be rolled out on August 20 - Android Community](https://androidcommunity.com/android-p-will-reportedly-be-rolled-out-on-august-20-20180803/)

I've been running Android P on my Pixel 2 for a couple of weeks and I have not had any problems with it. I also think it is an iterative improvement on Oreo, meaning that if you don't have It you aren't necessarily missing out. 

[Android Police has a complete rundown](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/24/every-new-android-p-feature-weve-found-far-continuously-updated/) of all the new things. Oddly, my favorite may be the charging sound, as I have had cases when I thought I was charging my phone when I wasn't because the charger was completely plugged in.  The cleaned up settings and notifications are nice, and the navigation improvements are ok but not amazing. I am still looking for significant improvement in battery life.
