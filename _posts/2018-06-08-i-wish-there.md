I wish there was such a thing as insertion point actions on my personal devices, here is what I mean. If I am adding a task in [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/) on my iPad to call a friend, it would be really cool to just tap and hold, to get an Actions menu, from which I see an option that says "Add link to a contact."  A link would be pasted at the current location of the cursor.
