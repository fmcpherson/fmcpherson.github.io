[The Cubs picked up Daniel Murphy](https://www.mlb.com/news/daniel-murphy-claimed-off-waivers-traded/c-291272560) in a trade with the Nats. It is an interesting signing of a player who seems to hurt the Cubs whenever he plays them. A bit surprising as a depth sign at Second considering they have Zobrist. 

I am heading down to Comerica Park to watch the Cubs and Tigers play.
