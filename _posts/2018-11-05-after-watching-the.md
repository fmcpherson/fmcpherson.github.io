After watching [The Verge review of the new iPad Pro](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features), I have the sense that the limitations of iOS make the processing power of the A12X moot and the switch to USB-C of questionable value. If you are going to provide desktop class hardware then you need to provide desktop class software, and iOS is not that, yet.
