[Stacey Harmon: "Why Michael Hyatt is Wrong about Organizing Evernote with Tags"](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2018/04/18/stacey-harmon-why-michael-hyatt-is-wrong-about-organizing-evernote-with-tags/)

> The right way for me — as well as the vast majority of the people I have coached over my years as an Evernote consultant — is by using notebooks and stacks as the primary organizing blocks of Evernote, with tags being used not as an organizational tool, but a find feature in Evernote.

I have used Evernote for a long time, and I use notebooks and stacks as the primary organizational method and tags to help find information. When seek information in Evernote I usually search for that information across all notes unless I expect to only find it in a certain notebook or stack.
