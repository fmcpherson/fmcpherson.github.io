So, it [turns out](https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/Houston-Astros-Boston-Red-Sox-ALCS-Game-5-recap-13318892.php) the 2018 Astros were not any better than the 2017 Cubs. 

Nothing is static, particularly baseball. It is not likely your team will be exactly the same, someone is going to get injured. More importantly, the competition is not going to stay the same, they are going to get better.
