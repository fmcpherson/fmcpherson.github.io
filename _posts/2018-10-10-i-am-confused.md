I am confused about the value of [the new Call Screen feature](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/pixel-3-price-google-hands-on) that Google plans to add to Pixel phones. I assume the primary purpose is to screen telemarketing calls, but doesn't the very act of answering the call provide a signal that the number is valid? I was under the impression the best thing to do with telemarketing is to not answer the call. 

Right now, if I get a call that I don't recognize, which is most, I decline the call. Period.
