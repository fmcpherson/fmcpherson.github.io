When is the last time you have heard serious discussion about how much money we spend in defense of the United States? [The military industrial complex](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/eisenhower-warns-of-military-industrial-complex) is so entrenched it isn't even brought up in passing when we talk of budget cuts within the U.S. government. Instead the conversation is about "entitlements" as if that is the only thing tax dollars is pent on. 

We can't say that we were not warned.
