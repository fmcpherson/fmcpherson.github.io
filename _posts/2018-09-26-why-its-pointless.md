[Why It's Pointless to Preach about Morals](https://www.castlechurchbrewing.com/blog/why-its-pointless-to-preach-about-morals?utm_source=Castle+Church+Newsletter&utm_campaign=18abb70072-CASTLE+CHURCH+Weekly+Summary&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8ea6a897f0-18abb70072-228238469&mc_cid=18abb70072&mc_eid=dd26c2cf1c#/)

>We base everything from our private morality to our public policies and every major value in between on this nebulous thing called “rights.”...

>But there are some issues with basing everything on rights. For one, they’ve tended to be negatively defined. “I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.”...

>This negative definition of rights is what inspired an entire book by the great 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer reflecting on the culture shock of his time spent teaching in New York. He was puzzled that we Americans seem to talk a lot about what we are “free from,” but hardly anyone ever brings up what we might be “free for.” Yes, there are all these things which we don’t want to infringe upon our lives. But what are we living for? What positive thing should we be seeking to enrich and improve our lives?
