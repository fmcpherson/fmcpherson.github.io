[The Fourth National Climate Change Assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) was published by the POTUS administration on Black Friday. Why they waited until then rather than on a day of an Apple announcement is beyond me. Go read it while it is still on the web and before POTUS has it taken down, because he doesn't believe it.
