Looking at [my Geekbench profile](https://browser.geekbench.com/user/120423) that shows the performance of my computers, I think you get an understanding of why Meltdown exists. 

What you see is computers with nearly the same clock speed and number of cores but widely different performance. I think it shows that while the physical performance (clock speed) is nearly the same, newer chips perform better due to all the parallel processing occuring within the chip.
