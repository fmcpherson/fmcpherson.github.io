What is the best ssh app to use on an iPad? Right now I use [Termius](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/termius/id549039908?mt=8), but it does this thing where it doesn't scroll properly as the screen fills up so I have to do some dragging around to re-align the display. I also am turned off by the $29/year subscription cost and there are some premium features I wouldn't mind having. It is, however, the most recently updated app in the store.

[WebSSH Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webssh-pro/id497714887?mt=8) and [Prompt 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt-2/id917437289?mt=8) are two other alternatives that appear at the top of a Google search.
