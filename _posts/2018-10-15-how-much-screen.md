How much screen time is too much screen time? Looking at the [Digital Wellbeing Android app](https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/digital-wellbeing-beta/), there were only two days last weekn when my Pixel 2 screen was on for more than an hour. Only three times last week I uinlocked my phone more than 20 times. 

The main problem I see with Digital Wellbeing is that it doesn't easily show history or averages. You open the app and see your current consumption, but that info is not useful when it is not related to anything. The [Screen Time setting in iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982) shows averages and how that relates to prior weeks.

Still, while the information in Screen Time is interesting, it says I pick up my iOS devices (two iPads) on average 42 times a day, I have no idea what that means? Is it good? bad?
