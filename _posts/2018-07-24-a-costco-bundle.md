[A Costco bundle like this](https://www.costco.com/Microsoft-Surface-Go-Bundle---Intel-Pentium---1800-x-1200-Display---Windows-10-in-S-Mode---Surface-Type-Cover.product.100428070.html) is how I purchased my Surface 3. 

If I didn't own the iPad Pro 10.5 I would probably be all over the Surface Pro Go.
