[Ilia Delio, OSF](https://www.omegacenter.info/schism-or-evolution/): 
>The Benedict Church holds that orthodoxy or the true teaching of the Church resides in the unbroken apostolic tradition of the Petrine tradition, the men ordained and ontologically changed by the sacrament of Holy Orders. 

In my opinion, the above is the closest I've seen written to what I think is the root problem within the Roman Catholic church. It is too simplistic to state the problem is gay priests or celibacy or not ordaining women, all those are simply symptoms to the problem, a problem more closely related to why the Roman Catholic church exists as an institution.
