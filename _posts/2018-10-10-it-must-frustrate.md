It must frustrate Detroit Tiger fans to see so many former Tigers in the MLB Playoffs. The Red Sox have three former Tigers playing for them in this game against the Yankees. Not to mention the Red Sox GM, who used to be the Tigerâ€™s GM and then you have Justin Verlander over on the Astros. 

Looks like the it will be Red Sox vs. Astros in the ALCS, with Dodgers vs. Brewers in the NLCS. Both will be good series.
