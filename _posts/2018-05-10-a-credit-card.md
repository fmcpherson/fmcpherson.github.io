A credit card company [robot keeps calling my smart phone](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17071478/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android) and neither Google nor [Nomorobo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nomorobo&hl=en_US) is able to catch it because each call is from a different number and often local. Right now, if caller ID doesn't show something I recognize, I don't answer the phone. 

I personally think we need to outlaw phone calling robots, before [Google Duplex](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335710/google-duplex-phone-call-ai-assistant-service-industry) gets entrenched.
