Google classifies the Pixel Slate as [a Tablet with Google Assistant](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate). Based on [my definition of tablets](http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/11/my-definition-of.html), the Slate is not a tablet, it is a 2-in-1. If you stick to Google's view of it as a tablet then I stand by [my initial impression](http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/09/first-reaction-to.html) that the Slate could be DOA. 

My concerns about it are driven by the total cost of ownership. I start with the 8 GB, 64 GB, Intel Core M model that costs $799, and then add a keyboard, either the Google keyboard that costs $199 or the [Brydge G-Type](https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate) that costs $159, making the minimum total cost $958; throw in the pen and that is just north of $1,000. For my money I much rather buy the Pixelbook or any one of the newer Chromebooks than pay $1000 for the Slate 2-in-1. Arguably [the Surface Pro 6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5?icid=surfacedept_nav3_surfacefamily_100218&activetab=pivot:techspecstab) is a better option, and it would definitely be better for me because I know I can use a pen with OneNote.

The Slate does look like a nice piece of hardware, and if you want Android and Linux apps on a 2-in-1 it's your only viable option, but is that option more appealing than an iPad Pro? Particularly a newer, larger screen, same form factor, smaller bezel iPad Pro? I am skeptical.
