Is there an advantage to [writing something in Draft](https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/screencasts/)s and then pushing it over to micro.blog? One reason is that it is faster to paste a hyperlink into a post in Drafts than in the micro.blog iOS app. 

Drafts and Workflow are the two iOS apps that I really want to learn more about this year.
