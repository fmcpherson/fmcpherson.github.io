I think [the problem with articles like this one](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675232/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey-free-speech) from the Verge about free speech and social networks is that they don't get to the root cause, which are the conclusions and decisions people are making based on what they hear.

For example, there is no skepticism applied when one is telling another what they want to hear. When a politician holds a rally for their base, does anyone attending that rally ask themselves why the event is being held? What is the purpose? Is that I am being told true, or simply being said to earn my support.
