Really disappointed by the news that [Google will be shutting down Inbox](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17848500/google-inbox-shut-down-sunset-snooze-email-march-2019). I think it is the best email app for smartphones because it makes it real easy to triage email. 

I am not surprised by the news, we say this coming and I've been using the Gmail app on desktop and tablets and Inbox on my Pixel and iPad Mini.
