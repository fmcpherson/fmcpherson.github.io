I guess that I am getting old, I don't get microcasts. For my ears, podcasts can be too long AND too short. Something that you say in two minutes can be written. Printed words, on the web, is the primary way I consume information. Audio adds anothe format requiring additional hardware. I recognize that I may be exhibiting how I have been programmed by media companies all these years.
