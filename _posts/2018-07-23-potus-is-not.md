POTUS is [not allowed to drive a car](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/bidenrsquos-corvette-fact-is-nations-leaders-not-allowed-to-drive/). I am beginning to think POTUS should not be allowed to use social networks either. Congress could pass a law. Do we really want to end up in a war because of a tweet?
