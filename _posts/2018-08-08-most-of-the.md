Most of [the reviews](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17663494/microsoft-surface-go-review-specs-performance) that I have read about the Surface Go have been positive. First, I note that all reviews are of the high-end, 8 GB model. Second, I can't help but feel that everyone is desperate for a competitor to the iPad and therefore will praise up any attempt. 

Personally, I think the main issue is price. At a minimum Microsoft should be bundling the keyboard with the device at the price of that $650 price. I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.

Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand. If you just consume content you can live without the keyboard and stylus.
