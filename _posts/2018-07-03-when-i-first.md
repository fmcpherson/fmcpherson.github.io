[When I first heard the rumor](http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/06/30/microsoft-details-secret.html) about Microsoft's foldable tablet called Andromeda my reaction was why? Now I hear [it may not happen after all](https://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-surface-phone-andromeda-what-went-wrong-again-03536394/). 

I still wouldn't mind an iPad Mini that worked with the Apple Pencil.
