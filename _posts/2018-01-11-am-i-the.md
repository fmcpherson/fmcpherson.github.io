Am I the only one suspicious of [wage increase announcements like Walmarts](https://www.axios.com/walmart-boosting-1515675530-f1641dc4-c92c-4002-ab00-b2e8cf35d540.html)? Most of these corporations have been profitable for many years, so I doubt they needed the tax cut to increase the wages. And why the need for a public announcement?
