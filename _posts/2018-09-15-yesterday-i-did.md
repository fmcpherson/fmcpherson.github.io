[Yesterday I did](https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/14/ive-factory-reset.html) a factory reset of my Fossil Q Explorist watch in the hope I would see improved battery life. So far I have had success. Before the reset the watch consumed 15% battery in an hour, today so far my watch has only consumed 7% in two hours. I only have a minimal set of apps on the watch, but I really think the problem occurred when I upgraded my phone to Android Pie. Moral is to do a reset upon such upgrades.
