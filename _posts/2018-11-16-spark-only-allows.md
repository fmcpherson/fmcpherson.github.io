[Spark only allows me](https://helpspot.readdle.com/spark/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=1225) to create reminders for outgoing email. I wish I could create a reminder for mail that is in my Inbox. While I can snooze that email, it just re-appears and I don't see a notification. I am now trying the alert part of snooze to see if that works. 
*Update: I did find that turning alert on triggers a notification that fires at the time of the snooze. If you go in to Settings, Scheduling, Snoozes and enable Default Alert then I think alerts will be on by default. If there is something important I will either dump in to Reminders or Noteplan.*
