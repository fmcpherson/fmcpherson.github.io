For the last couple of weeks I have been using [NotePlan](https://noteplan.co/), and I think what I like most about it is that you end up with a daily log of what you did. [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) looks like a similarly useful tool, but not available on iOS, but I like outliners. The feature I want in an outliner is simple linking both with an outline file and to external items.
