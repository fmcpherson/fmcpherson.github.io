I got my Peel, [Super Thin Pixel 2 case](https://buypeel.com/products/super-thin-pixel-2-case), and it is indeed very small and very light. So small and light that I now realize frequent removal may be problematic without breaking the case. OTOH, it enables one to retain the Pixel 2's small size where the other Google cases I have been using do add bulk.
