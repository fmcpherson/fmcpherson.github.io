[I disagree a bit](https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/5-questions-for-cubs-in-2018-19-offseason/c-297116468) with Epstein's view on the leadoff spot in the Cubs lineup. It clearly has been a problem, but it is also about the 2nd spot. When the Cubs have had success it has been due to the catalyst in the 1 and 2 spots in the lineup.
