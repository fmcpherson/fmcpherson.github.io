[Aaron Rodgers has been playing hurt](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2806332-whats-wrong-with-aaron-rodgers?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29) and there isn't enough talent on the offense to help pick him up a bit. I expect that if the Packers lose a couple more games to be completely eliminated from the playoffs, Rodgers will go on IR. 

The real downside is that all the injuries provide an excuse to keep Mike McCarthy.
