I just discovered the new Siri shortcuts in settings. It noticed three web sites that I opened, including this site. I recorded a shortcut, â€œopen my blog" and now I can tell Siri to open this site in Safari. It also noticed a Workflow that I had created, so I think it might be possible to create one in which I do tell Siri to share a web page.
