It strikes me that [Apple's plans for running iOS apps on MacOS](https://mondaynote.com/ios-macos-what-no-actually-means-90b9fb2c46c7) looks very similar to Google's running Android apps on ChromeOS. [Google is providing for mouse support in Android apps](https://developer.android.com/topic/arc/input-compatibility), which makes me wonder why Apple couldn't add mouse support to iOS on iPads? There isn't sa technical reason, I suspect it's all about preserving Macs, assuming lack of mouse support in iOS is strong impediment to using iOS for productivity work.
