I am playing with [Monica](http://monicahq.com) and realizing that what I may need is a tool to manage relationships, but not just relationships with people. In my work I manage a number of different things and the relationships between them. For example, I may do research that relates to an opportunity that relates to certain people. What I want is an easy tool for maintaining those relationships.
