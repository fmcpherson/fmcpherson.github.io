I was on [the MobileViews Podcast](https://mobiletoday.podbean.com/e/mobileviews-podcast-275-10-year-retrospective/) this past weekend, and I talked about Google's operating systems and commented on how few new operating systems came it to market during the ten years of the podcast.. Chrome OS, first released in 2011, is the newest I've used, and even that can be debated because it uses a Linux Kernel. 

According to my past weblog posts, [WebOS may be the newest](https://fjmnotes.com/2009/01/10/giving-palm-its-just-due/) prior to Chrome OS. Android and iOS already existed for a few years. 

This is why I am so intrigued by Google's work on [Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia).
