[Michigan Tech's annual Winter Carnival](https://www.mtu.edu/carnival/) is in progress, with the snow statue competition completing this morning. I attended Tech from 1984-89 and have good Carny memories. The number of hours students put in to building these statues is incredible and the results are fantastic. Check out [the photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigantech/collections/72157662834921158/)!
