Are good speakers really an important component for a smartphone? Google's commitment to dual front facing speakers is a head scratcher. I know it was HTC's thing back in the day, but if I am listening to audo on my Pixel I am using a headset. If I want to fill a room with sound I will connect to an external speaker using Bluetooth or Chromecast.
