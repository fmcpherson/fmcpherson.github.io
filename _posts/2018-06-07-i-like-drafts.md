I like Drafts, but I think the concept behind it is nonsensical. The idea of Drafts is that you use it to write and edit any text that you can then send to other apps, which also have the capability to write and edit text. So, you see "actions" in Drafts for entering tasks in apps like OmniFocus and Todoist, but why is that easier than just entering information in Microblog, OmniFocus and Todoist? It seems to me that people who use iOS for productivity are so enamored by the workflows they have created they don't seem to realize the workflows are basically workarounds for deficiencies that existed in previous versions of iOS. 

I am finding the number of iOS apps that basically do the same thing insane! Really, how many markdown editors are needed?
