I am interested to see how well received [Psion's Android clamshell device](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-42577476/ces-2018-electric-virtual-reality-suit-shocks-gamers) will be at CES. [Psion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_(company)) is a blast from the past, at it's height it was competing with Palm and Windows CE with its own operating system, and now it will be running Android. If it is priced around $300, I might be interested in buying one.

And it's British, so there is that.
