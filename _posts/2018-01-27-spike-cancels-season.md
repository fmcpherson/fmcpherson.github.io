 [Spike cancels season 3 of the Shannara Chronicles](http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/17/shannara-chronicles-canceled/)

I binged season 2 on Netflix last night, after being surprised to find it as I didnâ€™t know it was made. I read the Shannara books a long time ago and I have fun trying to remember parts of the book while watching, although I know the TV Series is not an exact depiction.
