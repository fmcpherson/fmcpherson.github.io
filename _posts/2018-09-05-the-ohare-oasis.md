[The O'Hare Oasis is now closed](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-ohare-oasis-shutdown-20180905-story.html#nws=true). Making way for progress.  In my travels around Chicago, I usually stop at the Hinsdale and Lake Forest Oasises(?) so this won't personally affect me, but sad just the same.
