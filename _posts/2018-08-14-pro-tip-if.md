[Pro tip](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-location-tracking-turn-it-off-for-real/): If you do not want your location tracked, do not have on your person something that contains a radio, like a smartphone. Otherwise, always assume that your whereabouts can be tracked.

People managed to survive hundreds, neigh thousands, of years without carrying a smartphone every where they go. You can do it.
