Despite what you might hear about one person or another having "all the qualifications" to be a Supreme Court Justice, [there are actually no constitutional qualifications](https://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-u-s-supreme-court) for a Supreme Court Justice.

When someone says a person is qualified, what they really mean is that they think that person agrees with their ideology.
