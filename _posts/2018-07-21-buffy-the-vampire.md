[Buffy The Vampire Slayer reboot revealed with Joss Whedon onboard - SlashGear](https://www.slashgear.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-reboot-revealed-with-joss-whedon-onboard-20538369/) 

I have mixed feeling about this news. As time has past I have accepted the series is done and moved on. In some ways it would be nice to leave it be. On the other hand, knowing Joss is behind this has me curious to see where he takes the story. I think Joss is smart enough to know a reboot cannot try to be the same. In the meantime, lots can happen for this to not happen.
