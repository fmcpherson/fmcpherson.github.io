[Patagonia is giving its workers Election Day off â€” and says you should, too - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/06/patagonia-is-giving-its-workers-election-day-off-and-says-you-should-too/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b37ab4df9439)

It should be obvious that politicians do not want high voter turnout otherwise there would be a law or amendment to make election day a national holiday, or move it to a Saturday. The same applies to education in the United States. Changes have intentionally not been made because those in power benefit from the status quoe.
