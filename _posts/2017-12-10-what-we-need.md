> "Wisdom comes from dealing rightly with the information, but information has become a consumer item in its own right. We have no place deep inside us to integrate this information and transform it into wisdom. Hence our social system may produce many specialists, but very few wise men and women. And in the end weâ€™re short of knowledge, wisdom, and time." from "Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go" by Richard Rohr
