First reaction to the #madebygoogle event. Meh. I think the Pixel Slate is DOA with a [starting price](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate_specs) of $599 for a 4GB RAM 32 GB storage tablet when one can by an iPad with 128 GB of storage for $429. The lowest price iPad Pro is $649, which is cheaper than a comparable Pixel Slate priced at $799. 

Given these prices and how the compare with iPad, I don't understand why Google is even bothering with a tablet.
