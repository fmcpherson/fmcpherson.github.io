Interesting story about [corner stores](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/7/9/evolution-of-the-corner-store). When I was growing up the nearest grocery store, one of these corner stores, was DeRidders. In the late 70s a fire gutted the building and the owner built a [much smaller "party" store across the U.S. highway from the old site](https://goo.gl/maps/uGbj5AdMq6K2). 

In its day DeRidders was one of maybe a half dozen grocery stores in my small home town. Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.
