Icro is a micro.blog app for iOS, and [it is now open source](https://github.com/hartlco/Icro). I like the full screen display of Icro and the fact that when I return to the app it displays were I last left off in my timeline. However, I like how the micro.blog app for iOS displays conversations. I wish the micro.blog app had a full display rather than its current split between timeline and options.
