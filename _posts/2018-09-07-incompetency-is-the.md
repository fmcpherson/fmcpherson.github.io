[Incompetency](https://politicalwire.com/2018/09/07/we-are-a-superpower-run-by-a-simpleton/) is the primary reason why I could not and did not vote for Trump.  Current politics makes the problem worse. Not enough people took competency seriously enough and we are starting to pay the price. 

The problem is that too many people confuse politics with competency, by which I mean they don't think Trump is incompetent they just think Democrats and Republicans are simply preventing him from doing the job.
