On the way home last night from a gathering of friends in Royal Oak, I stopped at a store and found some [Founders KBS](https://foundersbrewing.com/our-beer/kbs/) and [Atwaters Blueberry Cobbler](http://www.atwaterbeer.com/beer-type/berry-cobbler-ale/#) for sale. The store owner started the day with 12 cases of KBS and had 2 left by 8:30 PM and will probably be sold out by this afternoon. Right place, right time for me.
