You may have noticed that I made a change to the layout and appearance of this site. The new theme is similar in appearance to the theme on [my Jekyll site](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net). I may be contrarian, but I prefer blogs that make text easier to read over blogs that emphasize graphics. (I also dislike white text on black backgrounds because that messes up my eyes.)

One thing that I notice is that in this format the date of the post is at the top of the post, giving the appearance of a title and that makes me wish that such posts were all consolidated on to one page like [previous incarnations](http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net) of my blog.
