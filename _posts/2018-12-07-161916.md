I am watching [Chromeunboxed's review of the Google Pixel Slate](https://chromeunboxed.com/news/google-pixel-slate-review). The Slates's support for mice and trackpads may be the most compelling advantage it has over the iPad. For desktop use, I would pair it up with a standard Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. I don't often type with a keyboard on my lap. If I were to attend a meeting or conference I rather use a stylus and hand write notes.
