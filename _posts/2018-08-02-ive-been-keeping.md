I've been keeping an eye out for the Acer Chromebook Spin 13, but [now that I see the pricing](https://liliputing.com/2018/08/acer-chromebook-13-chromebook-spin-13-coming-in-september-for-650-and-up.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29) I am conflicted. At that $750 price it might be worth just buying the current Google Pixelbook.
