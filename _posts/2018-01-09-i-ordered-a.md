I ordered a Pixel 2 case on December 20 and just got the shipment notification today, which says it will arrive by the end of the week. The case is not one of the custom design options, so there is no really good reason why it has taken this long for Google to ship to me a simple case. Particularly when the originating location is Chicago and I am in Detroit.
