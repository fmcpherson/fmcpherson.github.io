 [He died for our debts, not our sins](https://renegadeinc.com/he-died-for-our-debts-not-our-sins/)

If we think deeply about the consequences of debt you see meaning. Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free. 

As we in the United Stated look more and more like the [Ferengie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi) every day, it may be helpful to replace the word "sin" with "debt" more often.
