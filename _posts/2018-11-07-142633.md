I am not feeling euphoric by seeing Democrats win the House. I am heartend by the number of women who ran and won, but this is just the first step. Before [the Dems go crazy with investigations](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/democrats-trump-investigations/), they should consider why Trump won in the first place. We need progress on real issues more than we need revenge.

If the Democrats in the House fall into the trap of Washington nazel gazing this small victory could lead to a Trump re-election in 2020. Yes, provide oversight, but more importantly listen to **all** of your constituents and try to do something to help them!
