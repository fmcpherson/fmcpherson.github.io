One thing lacking is discourse and the desire to find lasting solutions to problems. There is a difference in a dogmatic view to problems, by which I mean a view in which solutions are pre-determined and implemented no matter what, and a scientific view that presents ideas (hypothesis) that are proven not to be false. 

The key element to an hypothesis, or an idea, is the opennes to it being wrong.
