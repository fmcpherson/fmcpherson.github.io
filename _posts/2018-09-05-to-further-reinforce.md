To further reinforce [the point I made earlier](http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/05/145541.html) that the Democrat strategy this fall ought to be focus on Congress' constitutional role, I refer to you [this written by Alan Jacobs](https://blog.ayjay.org/populist-leaders-and-the-defiance-of-norms/):
>Norms are created by institutions, and we live in an age of weak and despised institutions. This is how populist leaders arise: when a great many people believe that institutions exist merely to serve themselves, they come to despise not just those institutions but also the norms associated with them, and applaud leaders who scorn and seek to tear down the whole edifice.
