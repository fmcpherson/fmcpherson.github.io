I just published [a post on one of my Wordpress blogs](https://the-narthex.org/2018/06/16/daryl-madden-unlearn/) using Ulysses for iOS, which I have used to publish before, and for some reason the markdown for hyperlinks was not properly recognized. Does anyone know if something has changed with Wordpress?
