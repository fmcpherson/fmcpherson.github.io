Looked at [the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Yoga-Chromebook-C630/p/88YGCC61096) and the HP X360 14 at Best Buy over the weekend. The C630s being sold by Best Buy do not have a backlit keyboard while the ones sold directly by Lenovo do, according to a Lenovo rep. Apparently the want to entice people to buy direct.
