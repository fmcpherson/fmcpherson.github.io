My Flickr Pro account is coming up for renewal and I am wrestling over whether to renew it. The cost has doubled since I first signed up and I don't think I get double the value. On the other hand, I've used Flickr for more than a decade and there is a part of me that wants to see it continue. If the price had remained the same, I don't think I would be having this internal debate.
