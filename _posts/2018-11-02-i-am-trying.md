I am trying out [TrunkNotes](https://www.trunknotes.com/), which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to [VoodooPad](https://www.voodoopad.com/). ~~One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.~~

Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.
