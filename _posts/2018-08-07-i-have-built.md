I have built myself a remote Linux Ubuntu/XFCE session using [these instructions](https://cepa.io/2018/08/05/building-an-ultimate-remote-linux-workstation/) and a VM I created at [CloudAtClost](https://www.cloudatcost.com). The VM I created had 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM and runs pretty well, at least for text entry and email processing. Now, if only I could find a working X2GO client for iOS, the one in the app store does not run on my iPad Pro.
