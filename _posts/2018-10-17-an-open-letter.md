[An Open Letter To the So-Called Exhausted Majority](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/mercynotsacrifice/2018/10/16/an-open-letter-to-the-so-called-exhausted-majority/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Progressive+Christian&utm_content=43):

>The thing that makes everybody exhausted is when people are speaking and acting out of a need to be right all the time. That need to be right is the thing that I most need to be saved from. When I’m okay with being wrong and letting others teach me something, I’m less exhausting to them.
