 [gr36.com Review of Bear](https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/)

I am surprised that few, if any, reviews of notes apps like Bear don’t address security.  Can you encrypt the content you put in the app? How easy is that encryption? Can you encrypt entire notes? Notebooks? Or just snippets of text? And who holds the keys?
