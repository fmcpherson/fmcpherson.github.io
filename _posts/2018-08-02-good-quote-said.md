[Good quote](https://john.philpin.com/2018/03/31/as-democracy-is.html). Said differently, democracy is not what our small self wants. We much rather just have someone take care of us. True originalists understand that the founders did not build a Presidency, they built a Congress. 

The problem is that for the last 100 years Congress has been about building a Presidency.
