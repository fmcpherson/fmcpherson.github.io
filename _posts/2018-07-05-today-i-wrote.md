Today I wrote a [new article](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/ipad/2018/07/05/using-noteplan-to-manage-personal-projects.html) on my site hosted by Netlify that includes an image that I have stored in a S3 bucket. The bucket is not set up for HTTPS. Netlify has sent me an email that mixed, insecure content has been detected on my blog. 

Sigh. Now I have to go and figure out how get that bucket, which is hosting my [personal profile](http://frankm.org) set up with HTTPS. Fortunately, it is a simple bucket, but really, this whole ham-handed push to HTTPS is getting old, fast.
