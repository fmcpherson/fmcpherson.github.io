News about [the Black Friday sale on the Google Pixelbook](https://chromeunboxed.com/grab-a-pixelbook-for-699-on-black-friday-and-score-3-months-of-youtube-tv/) has me reconsidering [my plan](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html) to buy a new Chromebook. 

While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.  On the other hand, that U processor in the Lenovo is definitely better performing that the Y processor, which Apple choose for the new Macbook Air. 

I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering. Food for thought, does anyone have advice on which one to go with?
