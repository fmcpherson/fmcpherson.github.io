I host an application on Amazon Lightsail, and I originally provisioned the then lowest priced instance, which cost $5 per month for 1 vCPU and 512 MB of RAM.

Two months ago I determined the app needed more memory, so I decided it worth upgrading to the $10 per month, 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM plan. 

Last month Amazon released [new monthly pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?fl=sp2) that lowered the price of the 1 vCPU and 1 GB instance to $5 per month. 

Cloud computing is the one thing that I use where the cost truly decreases over time and it just happens. I did not know about the change in pricing until I got the bill for last month and saw it was lower.
