[The user experience with Federated Wiki](http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/computers/view/google-pixelbook) is different than what most people have with web pages. First, Federated Wiki is a web application and its "pages" are smaller and appear to the right within the same browser tab. The result is that you can see trial of pages as you click links within a wiki. (External links load pages in a new browser tab.)

The question is, do users like this different navigation and presentation model? Prior generation wiki follows the traditional web page model.
