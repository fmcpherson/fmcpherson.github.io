Microsoft PowerPoint for iOS is shockingly awful. All I need to do is create one slide, with a picture, and some text, and I find that impossible to do with PowerPoint on iOS. You type a character and wait, I did you not, ten seconds, for it to appear on the screen and the cursor to move. How can Microsoft, in 2017, produce such a horribly performing test? Do they not even test these things?
