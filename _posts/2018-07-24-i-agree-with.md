[I agree with Slashgear](https://www.slashgear.com/keep-your-iphone-or-galaxy-note-ipad-best-tablet-android-guide-23538525/) that users ought to be looking at lower cost tablets over more expensive smartphones. The majority of my personal computing is done on a tablet, either an iPad Mini or an iPad Pro. I use my smartphone when when I don't have my tablet or in location where using a tablet is not practical.
