I’m watching the [All About Android podcast](https://twit.tv/shows/all-about-android) in which they are talking about the [Samsung foldable screen](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18072514/samsung-foldable-phone-screen-features-photos-sdc-2018) and they’re talking about it in terms of a foldable phone. I wonder whether we should really be thinking about this as a foldable tablet rather than phone?
