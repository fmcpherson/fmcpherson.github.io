I've got Android Messages for Web enabled and I found that it does work with Chrome on iOS, however I haven't received notifications for new in-bound messages on iOS. You can also set up Messages for Web with multiple computers but only one can be active at a time. I have to admit, this seems to work pretty well and helps me get past a limitation with Pushbullet on iOS.
