If you did not vote in 2016 and were shocked that Trump won, please know that one very big reason why he did win is because people did not vote. Not voting tomorrow is a vote in support of a Republican controlled government and we know that Republicans cannot govern. If you want change, it starts tomorrow with your vote.
