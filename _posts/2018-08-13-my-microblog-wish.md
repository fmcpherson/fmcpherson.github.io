I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to [my blog](https://frankmcpherson.blog). Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frankm) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank), but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn. 

What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook. 

To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more "professional." 

Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don't make sense for those audiences.

I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it's a write once experience meaning that edits don't get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn't a mechanism to do so.
