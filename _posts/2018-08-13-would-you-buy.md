Would you buy a smartphone specifically because it could also [serve as your desktop computer](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17675072/galaxy-note-smartphone-software-feature-history-computer)? History shows such solutions have not worked well because there are too many compromises. In my opinion high performance wireless video is the missing ingredient.
