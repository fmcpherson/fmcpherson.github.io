Despite articles to the contrary, Android Wear keeps ticking along. The latest evidence is [Tag Heuer's newest watch](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/tag-heuer-connected-modular-41-smartwatch-news/). I believe more so than smartphones, Android Wear is really in the background such that it is more about companies like Tag Heuer and Fossil versus the Apple iWatch.
