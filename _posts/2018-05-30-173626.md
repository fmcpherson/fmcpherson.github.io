I think the root of [bad theology ](https://the-narthex.org/2018/05/30/the-importance-of-god-theology/) is the focus on the problem, sin, rather than on how things are supposed to be, oneness. If sin is separation from God, then racism is really the modern label for original sin. We are all connected and we are meant to see ourselves as connected to each other and God.
