I've been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.

Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage. 

Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.
