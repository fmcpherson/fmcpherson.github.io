The pricing and models for the Lenovo Yoga C630 are confusing. Let's start with Lenovo direct, [they list two models](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/perksoffer/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Yoga-Chromebook-C630/p/88YGCC61096?menu-id=Yoga_Chromebook_C630) one with a I3 processor, backlit keyboard and 64 GB of storage for $599, the other with the I5 and 128 GB of storage with backlit keyboard for $719. If you want a C630 with a backlit keyboard you can only buy one from Lenovo's web site.

[Best Buy has a version of the C630](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-midnight-blue/6295998.p?skuId=6295998) with an I5 128 GB of storage and no backlit keyboard for $649. Best Buy also has [the HP X360 X14 for $549](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-hp-finish-in-ceramic-white-and-cloud-blue/6301869.p?skuId=6301869). 

The low end Lenovo C630 that you can buy from their web site appears to compete head on with the HP X360 X14.
