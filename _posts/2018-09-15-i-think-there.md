I think there is a possibility for [Siri shortcuts](https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/) to be a really big hit for Apple, and Google needs to beef up Assistant to match. Over time I expect Siri to speed up how you use your iOS device. 

For example, right now I can tell Siri to open my blog and she starts Safari and opens this site. That saves me several taps. Right now I just made a shortcut to send text that I copy to the clipboard to Drafts. Highlight, copy to clipboard and then tell Siri to send this to Drafts. 

And this is just with the built-in functionality, soon I will be able to "program" my own shortcuts.
