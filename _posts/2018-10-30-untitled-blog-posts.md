[Untitled blog posts were a game changer for my writing](http://fionavoss.blog/2018/06/24/untitled-blog-posts/)

I think blog posts are a form of writing that is under appreciated. First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.

I don't write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one's voice. You don't have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.
