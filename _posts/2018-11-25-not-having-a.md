Not having a good fantasy football day. To of my key key players, Brandon Cooks and Tyreek Hill, have a bye, so I was filling the gaps and hoping for the best. My decision to start Duke Johnson over Chris Carson has not been good. Worse, Leonard Fournette got ejected from the game, so I can't count om him to expand his team leading points.
