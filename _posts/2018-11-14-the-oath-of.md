[The Oath of Office](http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/1b2.html) of the President of the United States:

>I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

At some point soon we may all need to decide what is more important, preserving, protecting, and defending the Constitution of the United States or keeping our party in office. 

As citizens of the United States this is our oath too, not just the oath of those whom we elect.
