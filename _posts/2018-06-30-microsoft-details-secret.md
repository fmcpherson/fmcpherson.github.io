[Microsoft details secret ‘pocketable’ Surface device in leaked email - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17518582/microsoft-surface-dual-screen-andromeda-device-pocketable)

What I find most intriguing about this leak is the idea of Microsoft inventing a new hardware category. Although, doesn't a pocketable Surface device sound like a Pocket PC? I am not entirely sure I need a dual screen device, but something the size of an iPad Mini optimized for a stylus might get my money.
