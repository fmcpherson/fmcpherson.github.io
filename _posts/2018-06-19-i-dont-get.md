I don't get the need for [Google Podcasts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts). There is already a section for Podcasts in Google Play Music that I have been using and have subscriptions. Google Podcasts isn't even smart enough to import my existing subscriptions. 

I don't listen to many podcasts any more now that I don't spend an hour a day in the car commuting to an office.  In fact, most of my recent podcast listening has been using Apple's Podcast app on an iPad.
