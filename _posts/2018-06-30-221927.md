Looking back at [another blog post I wrote after 9/11](http://web.archive.org/web/20021016214953/http://fmcpherson.weblogger.com/2001/09/22), and reflecting on the current state of the United States, I can't help but wonder whether what is happening now is leading to a new generation of terrorists.
