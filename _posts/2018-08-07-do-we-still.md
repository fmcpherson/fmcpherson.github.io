Do we still know what parts of the Internet are the public's and which part is the corporations? [The Internet began as a U.S. Department of Defense project](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet), funded by taxpayers and therefore owned by the public. At a minimum that part of the Internet should be open with free speech protections, but can we even find it? 

Our unwillingness to create new utilities, owned and protected by the government (too much like socialism) is to our detriment. Government should do more than spend billions on defense and enable corporate owners to get rich.
