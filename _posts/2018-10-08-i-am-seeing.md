I am seeing a [fair amount of excitement](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-pixel-slate-images-keyboard-cover-specifications-nocturne/) in anticipation of a possible Google tablet being announced tomorrow. The tablet will run the latest iteration of Chrome OS that runs Android and Linux apps.

Google does not have a tablet in its hardware lineup, so I understand it feels it has an opportunity to provide an alternative to the iPad. However, I am a bit skeptical about the potential for success. I think Apple may have what little there is of the tablet market sown up with the iPad. 

It looks like [there could be four different models](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixel-slate-nocturne-intel-configurations-celeron-m3-i5-i7/) of the Google tablet, no doubt to address different price points. I am interested to see what will be the lowest price for the tablet and how much functionality it will provide.
