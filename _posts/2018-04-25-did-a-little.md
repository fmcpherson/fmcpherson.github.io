Did a little more investigation into [the watch face that Fossil "pushed" to my smart watch last weekend](https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html). What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you "unlocked" a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each "new face" as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work. 

I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.
