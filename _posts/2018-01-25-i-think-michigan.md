I think Michigan State University President [Lou Anna Simon's resignation letter](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-michigan-state-lou-anna-simon-larry-nassar-20180124-story.html) says a lot for why Larry Nassar was enabled by the university. The following statement says to me, "I am not to blame, but since I am the President I am the scapegoat." MSU Alumni, parents, and students ought to be appalled by what appears to be institutionalized problems.

>As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.
