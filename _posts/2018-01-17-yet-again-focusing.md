The lesson to be learned from the false missile alert in Hawaii is **not** how someone screwed up, a bad communication plan, nor [bad UI design](https://hackernoon.com/redesigning-hawaiis-emergy-alert-interface-in-the-open-91c6318a7045?b9). The lesson that **should be** learned is that the possibility of a nuclear strick on the United States is much more plausible today that it has since the cold war. We appear to be nearing [Cuban Missile Crisis](http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis) territory with incompetent leadership in the government.
