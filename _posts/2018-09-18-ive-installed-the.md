I've installed [the new Shortcuts app](https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/) and so far see some good and some not so good. 

Good: I created a Siri Shortcut that turns on Do Not Disturb until a time I specify and the launches the Kindle app. 

Not so good: I've created a Siri Shortcut for a [action extension](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/extensions/sharing-and-actions/) workflow I have that shares the current web page in Safari as a link formatted in markdown. What I want to do is open a page in Safari, evoke Siri and say "share this page" however once Siri starts Safari is not accessible so the web page and URL cannot be obtained. 

Basically, I was hoping Siri Shortcuts would understand the context of what is on screen, but it cannot because once you launch Siri she has focus. As far as I can tell, you have to use the share extension to do what I am trying to do.
