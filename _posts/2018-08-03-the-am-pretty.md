I am pretty much following [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), hosting my content with domains I own on either [micro.blog](https://frankmcpherson.blog) or [Netlify](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net), and syndicating that content to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frankm), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank), and [Wordpress](https://fjmnotes.com). 

One problem with this approach is that syndication only occurs once. If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not. 

One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.
