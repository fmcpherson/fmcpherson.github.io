[The Packers have fired Mike McCarthy](https://www.packers.com/news/packers-announce-head-coaching-change), which given they will not make the playoffs, is in my opinion the remaining best outcome for this season. 

I am a long critic of McCarthy. I don't like how he contributed to running Brett Farve out of town. The team has clearly regressed in the last few years and while there has been a depletion of talent, McCarthy did not adjust well the personnel that was available.
