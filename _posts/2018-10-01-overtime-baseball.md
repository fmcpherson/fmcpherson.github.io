The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.

On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.

For me the Cub's chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana's ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub's need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer's bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer's bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.

Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don't think Maddon will manage in such a manner.
