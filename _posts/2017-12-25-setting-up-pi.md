I got a Raspberry Pi Zero W for Christmas that I am setting up, and so far not having much luck getting the OS to install. I think the file transfer is taking too long. I am regretting following the instructions literally, meaning I installed the Pi Zero in the case and there isn't an easy way to remove the micro SD card without removing them Zero entirely. 

Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it.
