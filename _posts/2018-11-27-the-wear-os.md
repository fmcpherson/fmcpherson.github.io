[The Wear OS "H" update](https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/563800?hl=en) arrived on my Fossil Q Explorist yesterday. I am curious to see how much battery life improves. Apparently Google has added a deep sleep mode that kicks in after 30 minutes of no activity, but I am not sure how activity is defined.
