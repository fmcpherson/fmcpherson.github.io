> "The disciples are still rooted in the entire system the Temple represents. They’re still marveling at the Temple structure. And Jesus’ reply is, “You see all these stones? In truth I tell you, not a single stone here will be left on another” (Matthew 24: 2b). It’s all going to fall apart. Will you stop putting your trust in it?" from "Jesus' Plan for a New World: The Sermon on the Mount" by Richard Rohr, John Bookser Feister

We are still too enamored with temple.
