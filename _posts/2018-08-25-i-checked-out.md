I checked out [the Windows 95 app](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows95) in Electron running on my Mintbox, and I have to admit that seeing the old UI and the inclusion of icons to set up AOL, Compuserve, and the Microsoft Network, brings back some good memories. Wish it included Solitaire, although the mouse isn't fast enough.
