Trumps tax cuts [are not cutting it](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-18/trump-s-tax-cut-hasn-t-done-anything-for-workers). The idea of cutting taxes will result in more jobs and higher wages is a myth. Corporations are hyper-optimized for shareholder return, which is done by cutting jobs and maintaining or lowering wages.

In almost all areas in the United States, mistakes are being made on the fundamentals. If the premise upon which a decision is based is wrong, then the decision and its consequences are wrong. 

The foundation is cracking, and nobody is willing to face up to this reality.
