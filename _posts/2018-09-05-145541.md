I agree with [Dave's high level plan](http://scripting.com/2018/09/03/154301.html), for the Democrat strategy this fall. It's about Congress doing it's job, which is to oversee the executive branch regardless of the party badge of the person holding the office. Oversight must be first, then party goals and not vice versa, that is how the Constitution is structured to enable a functioning government. 

The reason why some citizens may be willing to give up the republic for an authoritarian approach they think might be better is because of the ineffectiveness of Congress. Democrats have to remind and convince people that we ought not through out what actually is great about America.
