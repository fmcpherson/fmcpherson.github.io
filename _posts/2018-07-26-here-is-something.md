Here is something that I find ironic. [Google is taking the lead](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-https-not-secure-label/) towards pushing all web hosting on the Internet to use HTTPS. I have a blog that is hosted on Blogger, which is owned by Google. You can only [access that blog by HTTP](http://www.tech2watch.info/), [HTTPS does not work](https://www.tech2watch.info) automatically as it does Wordpress and many other blog hosting sites.
