Google is adding [the Android clock as a trigger for Assistant Routines](https://9to5google.com/2018/11/14/google-clock-assistant-routines/). I like the idea of the alarm triggering a routine, but I don't have a set alarm every day and actually use a routine to set my alarm each night, so I wonder how that will work.
