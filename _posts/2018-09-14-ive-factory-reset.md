I've factory reset [my Fossil Q](https://www.fossil.com/us/en/products/gen-3-smartwatch-q-explorist-luggage-leather-sku-FTW4004P.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwuO3cBRAyEiwAzOxKsi94BGhVSDK_JrykDn_BN5wCumApf4cobXA-rx4hByuSfhADR5oQJxoCBikQAvD_BwE&cid=pds:conv:google:PLA:Prospecting:ListingAds:Watches:PriorityTerms&ef_id=W1IqXQAABXHzfe4i:20180914202955:s) and it seems to be drawing less power, but I'll need to watch it more over time. I am reminded that I believe this happened when I last upgraded Android my phone, when that is done something seems to happen to the Bluetooth communication between watch and phone. The solution is to break the pair, which results in a factor reset of the watch.
