The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job. 

Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.
