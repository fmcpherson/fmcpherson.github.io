I don't know [how we fix societal issues](http://scripting.com/2018/09/29/004408.html). The society we live in so large with so many people needing to change, it just doesn't seem possible. 

Take for example the Civil Rights movement. I bet some thought that surely we had that race thing behind us. Sure, there will always be bigots, but it's not so entrenched in the fabric of society any more, is it? 

What we have learned in the last two years is no, society really hasn't changed much since the 60s, white people just pat themselves for the appearance.
