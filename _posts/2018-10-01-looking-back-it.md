Looking back, it occurs to me that [my analysis](http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html) of the Cub's performance in last year's playoffs might be applicable to this year too.

The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer's backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.
