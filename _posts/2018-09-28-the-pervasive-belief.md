The pervasive belief that girls and women just make stuff up about sexual assult is what enables it to happen in the first place. It's a belief perpetuated by boys and men to maintain their power. What is occuring right now is men in power maintaining their power. It's not about right or wrong. It's not about democracy or governing, it's all about privilege and power and getting what one wants. 

And what you see on your TV screen, that's a reflection of yourself. The problem isn't that it's happening, the problem is that you are ok with it.
