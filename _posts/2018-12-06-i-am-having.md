I am having problems at the moment using OneNote  on my iPad Pro, so have reverted to my backup Surface 3 and OneNote. What I had not appreciated up to now is how much better it is to write on the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil than on the Surface 3 and Surface Pen. I am finding writing it frustratingly slow to write on the Surface 3, and I would not have said that before having used the iPad Pro/Pencil for a year.
