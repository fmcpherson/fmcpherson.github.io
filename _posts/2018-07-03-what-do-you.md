What do you think about blog archives? I personally like a index of post blog posts that I've written to make it easier to go back and see my writing at that time. [The software](http://reader.smallpicture.com/?opmlurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fh44njkhogn65tpq%2FwebnotesArchive.opml%3Fdl%3D0#) I used in the past made it easy to see those monthly archives, but micro.blog does not. I can create an index using [a Wordpress site](https://fjmnotes.com), but I think I would prefer something built in to micro.blog.  If I were a programmer I suspect the JSON feed would be useful.
