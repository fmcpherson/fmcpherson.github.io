[New Apple Pencil 2018 charges wirelessly, has laser engraving - SlashGear](https://www.slashgear.com/apple-pencil-2018-release-date-price-details-features-laser-engraving-30551919/)

The new Pencil only works with the new iPads, probably due to the new charging method. I wonder if the price of the current Pencil, which is still needed for the iPad, will go down?
