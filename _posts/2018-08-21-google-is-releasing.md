Google is releasing [a new version of Google Fit](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/google-fit-gets-a-redesign-adds-heart-points-and-coaching/). I use Google Fit to track my walking. My issues with it are less to do with the apps and more to do with the data.

It is not obvious how to download your fitness data and Google doesn't really provide much in the way of analyzing data. When looking at data like this you want to see trends so you can answer questions like, did I walk more than last week? Did I walk more than last month? Last year? Improvement is measured over time not in a point of time. It is shocking to me that a company that bills itself as data driven is does not provide much, if anything, for analyzing this data.
