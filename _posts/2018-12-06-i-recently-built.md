I recently built [my own Federated Wiki server](http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net) and have been having a lot fun adding content to it since. I've found that for me it is the best way to maintain a "Now" page of things I am currently working on or researching. 

As a topic comes up, I got to [the Now page](http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/now) and create a wiki link to the topic, which I then click to create a new page to which I start adding content. 

What I need to determine is what to do with the topics that I complete. I think the ideal solution is a plugin that automatically generates an index of all pages in my wiki so that even when I remove the wiki link in the Now page, a link to the page remains somewhere so that it can be found later. I could manually build an index, but in this day and age I would think an automated approach would be possible and best.
