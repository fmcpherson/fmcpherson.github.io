Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider [my micro.blog](https://frankmcpherson.blog/) as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less. 

I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.

When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, [Let's Be Frank](http://writing.frankmcpherson.org), for long form writing. The "broad" push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called [1999.io](http://1999.io), and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don't think he is every going to convert to HTTPS. 

So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently [learned about Netlify from Jack Baty](https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/) and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: [low price](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/), easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility. 

Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following [their Jekyll tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/) and it didn't take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS. 

The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I've cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.

Right now [the new site](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net) is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.
