It does look as though [ChromeOS will be used for tablets](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965520/google-chrome-os-64-update-android-tablets-operating-system-replace) given that Google doesn't have an official Android tablet at the moment. I still think it needs to be pushed more as a competitor to the Microsoft Surface rather than the iPad.
