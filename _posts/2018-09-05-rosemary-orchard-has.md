[Rosemary Orchard](https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/) has brought to my attention [a tweet from Philips Hue](https://mobile.twitter.com/tweethue/status/1035527721986785280) that they are working on an update that will stop their lights from turning on automatically after a power failure and power is restored.

The behavior, which is not at all how physical switches work, has been my biggest gripe about using Hue, particularly for bedroom lights.
