I am wearing a Fossil Q Explorist, third generation. Battery life has been good enough to get through my day up until recently. It's hard to get solid evidence because the Wear OS app does not provide much useful info on power drainers. It feels as though the problem started when upgrading my Pixel 2 to Android P. Doing a factory resert and re-pair to see if that fixes it.
