I use [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) to host the Dockerized version of [a CRM application](https://www.monicahq.com/). There has just been a major release and the latest version of the Docker image is not working for me. I take snapshots of the server as a back up, so I was able to revert back to the prior version of the server pretty easily. The process does involve creating a new instance from a snapshot, moving the public IP address to the new instance, and then deleting the old instance.
