> "Communism tries to enforce equality, Nazism tries to enforce security and solidarity within a group, fundamentalist religion tries to shame and psychologically coerce people into an “only way.” The biblical God seems to just call us to simplicity and patience, which keeps us outside of every totalitarian big system or overarching explanation." from "Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go" by Richard Rohr
