I first learned how to blog by reading [Scripting News](http://scripting.com) and using Dave's tools. While I like most everything about those tools, I really like [the glossary](http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml#1535919507000) and wish other blog platforms had it. A glossary saves time by automatically creating links to items I always link to. It's a bit like a wiki or pre-saved short links.
