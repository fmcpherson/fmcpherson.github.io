&lt;p&gt;Maybe the DNC should be teaching their members about social engineering, phishing, and good security hygiene. Most hacks occur between the brain and the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still in the process of building muscle memory around the gestures in Android P, but this looks like a useful addition to Android.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am pretty much following &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;, hosting my content with domains I own on either &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, and syndicating that content to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/frankm&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjmnotes.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with this approach is that syndication only occurs once. If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/02/surface-go-review/&quot;&gt;Surface Go review: The ideal cheap Windows tablet… almost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Surface 3 because of its support for an active digitizer. Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don’t really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been keeping an eye out for the Acer Chromebook Spin 13, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://liliputing.com/2018/08/acer-chromebook-13-chromebook-spin-13-coming-in-september-for-650-and-up.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29&quot;&gt;now that I see the pricing&lt;/a&gt; I am conflicted. At that $750 price it might be worth just buying the current Google Pixelbook.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://john.philpin.com/2018/03/31/as-democracy-is.html&quot;&gt;Good quote&lt;/a&gt;. Said differently, democracy is not what our small self wants. We much rather just have someone take care of us. True originalists understand that the founders did not build a Presidency, they built a Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that for the last 100 years Congress has been about building a Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not been in the habit of migrating my blog posts between blog platforms, so I don’t intend to move posts into this site. My previous blogs are still online &lt;a href=&quot;http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To go even further back in time you can find posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjmnotes.com/2008/05/&quot;&gt;starting in 2008&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjmnotes.com&quot;&gt;my Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt;, to which I consolidate copies of all my social network updates and these blogs posts via a IFTTT recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

What this feature will do is show all the entries posted on a given date, no matter the year. If I had been using this site a year ago and you clicked On This Day above then you would see what I wrote this year and last year on this day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One reaction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/10/eu-hits-alphabet-google-with-android-antitrust-fine.html&quot;&gt;the EU decision regarding Android&lt;/a&gt; is that Google may have erred by making Android open source. A close source Android likely would have been bad for consumers and have prevented it from being as widely used as it is. We would likely be dealing with more than two defacto mobile OS standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/google-team-is-said-to-plot-android-successor-draw-skepticism&quot;&gt;Fuchsia the solution to Googles Android EU problem&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is something that I find ironic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-https-not-secure-label/&quot;&gt;Google is taking the lead&lt;/a&gt; towards pushing all web hosting on the Internet to use HTTPS. I have a blog that is hosted on Blogger, which is owned by Google. You can only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tech2watch.info/&quot;&gt;access that blog by HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tech2watch.info&quot;&gt;HTTPS does not work&lt;/a&gt; automatically as it does Wordpress and many other blog hosting sites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing threatens individual freedom and the meaning of life like war, poverty, terror. But there are also indirect and only slightly more remote dangers. One of these is the stupefaction of man . . . by mass culture with its intentional or commercially motivated lowering of intellectual level and content, with its stress on entertainment or utilitarianism, and with its carefully protective censorship. – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fifty-years-later-andrei-sakharovs-most-famous-essay-is-a-powerful-model-of-writing-for-social-change&quot;&gt;Andrei Sakharov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker article I link to above that includes the quote above is very good, recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing lacking is discourse and the desire to find lasting solutions to problems. There is a difference in a dogmatic view to problems, by which I mean a view in which solutions are pre-determined and implemented no matter what, and a scientific view that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fifty-years-later-andrei-sakharovs-most-famous-essay-is-a-powerful-model-of-writing-for-social-change&quot;&gt;presents ideas&lt;/a&gt; (hypothesis) that are proven not to be false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key element to an hypothesis, or an idea, is the opennes to it being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trumps tax cuts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-18/trump-s-tax-cut-hasn-t-done-anything-for-workers&quot;&gt;are not cutting it&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of cutting taxes will result in more jobs and higher wages is a myth. Corporations are hyper-optimized for shareholder return, which is done by cutting jobs and maintaining or lowering wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost all areas in the United States, mistakes are being made on the fundamentals. If the premise upon which a decision is based is wrong, then the decision and its consequences are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation is cracking, and nobody is willing to face up to this reality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I am at it, despite that I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, I have to confess that I don’t “get” micro.blogs. Perhaps I am being too literal. To me, a blog, is a blog, but there are titleless posts and posts with titles. Blogging back in 1999 was oriented around dates, and a weblog was a log of what one saw and reacted to on the web on a particular date. (In otherwords, titleless posts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I do get the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kfitz.info/feeds-and-gardens/&quot;&gt;coherent interaction relating to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that is probably the real, special sauce, to micro.blog. Back in 1999 we tried to implement this concept through link backs, but that had the challenge of notification of when someone did a link back so that you can participate in the “conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/Webmention&quot;&gt;Webmentions&lt;/a&gt; may be a better technlogical implementation of the link back concept. Ironic that the micro.blog blog doesn’t seem to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, being honest, I don’t write what I write on my blogs for the comments or the likes or the shares. I selfishly write for me, and if you the reader get value out of what I write, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess that I am getting old, I don’t get microcasts. For my ears, podcasts can be too long AND too short. Something that you say in two minutes can be written. Printed words, on the web, is the primary way I consume information. Audio adds anothe format requiring additional hardware. I recognize that I may be exhibiting how I have been programmed by media companies all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
