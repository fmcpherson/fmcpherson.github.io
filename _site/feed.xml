        <description>&lt;p&gt;American Christianity is as much an oxymoron as Roman Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you were a teenager in the 80s and did anything with a computer, you probably coveted Compute! Now you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/compute-magazine&quot;&gt;go back in time and browse through old issues&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first computer was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html&quot;&gt;Timex Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; 1000 that my grandmother gave me as a birthday present in 1983. I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000’s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today’s on-screen keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/&quot;&gt;printed in a magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What scares me most is that Trump supporters do not appear to have lines, by which I mean there is nothing Trump can do that will lose their support. Ought right determination to not change one’s mind, no matter what is frightening. Progress requires an openness to admitting that one is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feeling about this news. As time has past I have accepted the series is done and moved on. In some ways it would be nice to leave it be. On the other hand, knowing Joss is behind this has me curious to see where he takes the story. I think Joss is smart enough to know a reboot cannot try to be the same. In the meantime, lots can happen for this to not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: during a rain storm the best indoor place to hear the rain fall is an attached garage, assuming it is not insulated. An attic may be as good, but mine isn’t accessible. I stood in my garage for several minutes this morning listening to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;a href=&quot;https://solid.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently rewrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankm.org&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt; and implemented HTTPS using Amazon S3 and Cloudfront.  In my opinion S3 provides one of the easiest and least expensive ways to host a simple, static web site. Unfortunately HTTPS adds complexity, both in what you need to do to build the site and also in how you maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a brief survey and I think that that the simplest way to set up a web site with HTTPS is to host with a service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com&quot;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a free SSL certificate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/141#shared&quot;&gt;Bluehosts’s $8.99/month price&lt;/a&gt; is reasonable, but not as cheap as Amazon for a really small site like mine, which is a single HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my opinion with the current push to HTTPS,  you are better off going with a service provider that includes HTTPS as part of the service. If you are more technical and willing to fiddle with things, you can save money with S3/Cloudfront.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html&quot;&gt;Azure has a different approach to static sites&lt;/a&gt; because it associates a VM to the site rather than storage. The big difference is that you can’t associate a custom domain to the free tier, you will have to pay for the VM and it looks like you will need to buy a certificate. The upside to this approach is that you can implement SSL without having to use a CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website&quot;&gt;Google’s static website hosting&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much the same as AWS, and it also requires using a CDN if you want to implement HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the title of this book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://howtothinkbook.com/&quot;&gt;How to Think&lt;/a&gt;, my reaction was, “do we really need to teach people how to think?” Then I thought, yes, yes we do! More thinking and less reacting is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Eventually two points occurred to me. The first is that many of our fiercest disputes occur because the people involved simply aren’t thinking: they’re reacting or emoting or virtue-signaling or ingroup-identifying. The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The yellow represents a severe thunderstorm warning. The blue pin is my house, and immediately below is the rest of our condo complex. If I walked 5 minutes out my front door I would be out of the warned area.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-press-conference/index.html&quot;&gt;shocking&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has a very favorable view towards Putin and Russia. Russia is about the only place that will give Trump a loan. Putin has not personally offended Trump in any way, and Trump likely does admire what Putin has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Putin has to do is continue stroking Trump’s ego.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite what you might hear about one person or another having “all the qualifications” to be a Supreme Court Justice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-u-s-supreme-court&quot;&gt;there are actually no constitutional qualifications&lt;/a&gt; for a Supreme Court Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone says a person is qualified, what they really mean is that they think that person agrees with their ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting story about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/7/9/evolution-of-the-corner-store&quot;&gt;corner stores&lt;/a&gt;. When I was growing up the nearest grocery store, one of these corner stores, was DeRidders. In the late 70s a fire gutted the building and the owner built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/uGbj5AdMq6K2&quot;&gt;much smaller “party” store across the U.S. highway from the old site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its day DeRidders was one of maybe a half dozen grocery stores in my small home town. Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankm.org/&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt; and learned something about content delivery networks along the way. I host my profile in a S3 bucket that I have now configured for HTTPS. The only way to use Amazon’s SSL certificate is by using their CDN, Cloudfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun begins when you make changes to said web page and they never seem to appear, even though you know for certain the latest version of that page is in the bucket. Turns out you need to invalidate that page in the Cloudfront console to force it to be refreshed in the cache. Along the way I made changes to the TTL for the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All fun geeky stuff, but really too many hoops to serve a simple web page with one picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At its best, democracy balances the rights of the individual with the responsibility to participate in the public conversations and tasks that make civic community possible. However, the possibility of so stressing rights that we forget responsibility is a perennial threat to American liberty. The choice of privileging one over the other comes down to a simple, but profound question: “What is freedom for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember when Wimbledon was for the serve and volley? Watching Serena complain about the bad bounces coming from the chewed up grass and dirt in the baseline has me thinking, get up the court toward the net where the grass is greener. Not to mention a volley eliminates the bad bounce.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching tennis in HD has me wondering how I could have done so on a 19 inch set while growing up. Like playing tennis with a wood racquet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christian nation? Not according to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the gripping hand, in a year the price of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-go-specs-price&quot;&gt;the Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; may become low enough to make it a worthwhile replacement of my Surface 3. The Surface 3 is my only personally-owned Windows 10 machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the main problem with the Go is its price, I think Microsoft either needs to bundle the keyboard or drop the price down at least $100. What makes the Go appealing is the built-in kickstand and mouse support, both of which are things I miss using the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious to see how much smaller the Surface Go is compared to the Surface 3. Unfortunately for Microsoft, I’ve replaced the Surface 3 with a iPad Pro 10.5 and it is hard to see why I would want the new Go rather than the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/ipad/2018/07/05/using-noteplan-to-manage-personal-projects.html&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; on my site hosted by Netlify that includes an image that I have stored in a S3 bucket. The bucket is not set up for HTTPS. Netlify has sent me an email that mixed, insecure content has been detected on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Now I have to go and figure out how get that bucket, which is hosting my &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankm.org&quot;&gt;personal profile&lt;/a&gt; set up with HTTPS. Fortunately, it is a simple bucket, but really, this whole ham-handed push to HTTPS is getting old, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Micro.blog has a setting that I’ve been using that sends a copy of my content to a Github repo, and if that repo is configured for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt; then you basically end up with a second copy of your micro.blog site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I changed the theme for this blog the Jekyll build at Github started to fail. Every time I post something here I was getting error messages from Github. So, this afternoon I’ve been trying to fix the problem, deciding to just remove all the contents in Github and start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, now that I have removed everything, and even generated a new access token, nothing is transferring from here to there. I don’t know whether I broke something over perhaps exceeded some time of commit limit on a public repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I can put it into a new repo?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just discovered the new Siri shortcuts in settings. It noticed three web sites that I opened, including this site. I recorded a shortcut, “open my blog” and now I can tell Siri to open this site in Safari. It also noticed a Workflow that I had created, so I think it might be possible to create one in which I do tell Siri to share a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
