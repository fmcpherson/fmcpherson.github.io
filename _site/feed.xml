        <title>The Right To Not Be Forgotten</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web’s permanence, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten&quot;&gt;European Union even has a law&lt;/a&gt; in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html&quot;&gt;Dave currently thinks&lt;/a&gt; Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Dave’s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omegacenter.info/death-in-church-new-life-ahead/&quot;&gt;Barbara Brown Taylor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Human beings were so charmed by the illusion of control Newton’s metaphor offered that we began to see ourselves as machines too. Believing that Newton told us the truth about how the world works, we modeled our institutions on atomistic principles.
…
Our “God view” came to resemble our worldview. In this century, even much of our practical theology has also become mechanical and atomistic. Walk into many churches and you will hear God described as a being who behaves almost as predictably as Newton’s universe. Say you believe in God and you will be saved.  Sin against God and you will be condemned. Say you are sorry and you will be forgiven.  Obey the law and you will be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omegacenter.info/schism-or-evolution/&quot;&gt;Ilia Delio, OSF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Benedict Church holds that orthodoxy or the true teaching of the Church resides in the unbroken apostolic tradition of the Petrine tradition, the men ordained and ontologically changed by the sacrament of Holy Orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the above is the closest I’ve seen written to what I think is the root problem within the Roman Catholic church. It is too simplistic to state the problem is gay priests or celibacy or not ordaining women, all those are simply symptoms to the problem, a problem more closely related to why the Roman Catholic church exists as an institution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Packers made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24629977/aaron-rodgers-knee-green-back-packers-returns-game&quot;&gt;an incredible comeback&lt;/a&gt; last night because of Aaron Rodgers. The fact that team is so dependent on one player is nearly negligent. Wouldn’t it be prudent to have an experienced backup?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do the announcers of NFL games not know how idiotic the phrase “cannot tackle with all of your body weight” is? How does a defender tackle someone with half or part of their body weight?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgotten in how the women’s final of the U.S. Open ended is that the problems started with one of the most asinine rules of professional sports. Just stop having tennis chair umpires policing “coaching” from the stands. No gesture made by a coach is going to make a difference, the players still have to execute. Further, the rule is not in any way consistently applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tennis is not “special” because players are on their own, and fans pay good money to watch the players decide that match, not umpires.&lt;/p&gt;

Current politics makes the problem worse. Not enough people took competency seriously enough and we are starting to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that too many people confuse politics with competency, by which I mean they don’t think Trump is incompetent they just think Democrats and Republicans are simply preventing him from doing the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Founding Fathers were not unaware of the possibility that a demagogue or a knave might win the presidency. That’s why they checked the executive with an independent Congress and built in powers of impeachment. That Republicans in this Congress have proven so subservient to — or scared of — Trump that they have let the fate of the country hinge on whether his staff can adequately distract and calm him is a subversion of the constitutional order and an abdication of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To further reinforce &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/05/145541.html&quot;&gt;the point I made earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the Democrat strategy this fall ought to be focus on Congress’ constitutional role, I refer to you &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ayjay.org/populist-leaders-and-the-defiance-of-norms/&quot;&gt;this written by Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Norms are created by institutions, and we live in an age of weak and despised institutions. This is how populist leaders arise: when a great many people believe that institutions exist merely to serve themselves, they come to despise not just those institutions but also the norms associated with them, and applaud leaders who scorn and seek to tear down the whole edifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behavior, which is not at all how physical switches work, has been my biggest gripe about using Hue, particularly for bedroom lights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/03/154301.html&quot;&gt;Dave’s high level plan&lt;/a&gt;, for the Democrat strategy this fall. It’s about Congress doing it’s job, which is to oversee the executive branch regardless of the party badge of the person holding the office. Oversight must be first, then party goals and not vice versa, that is how the Constitution is structured to enable a functioning government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why some citizens may be willing to give up the republic for an authoritarian approach they think might be better is because of the ineffectiveness of Congress. Democrats have to remind and convince people that we ought not through out what actually is great about America.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/opinion/tn-blr-me-intheory-20180904-story.html&quot;&gt;In Theory: Does religious belief make the world more violent?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding of the above question and a good answer require contemplation on the words  “religious beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beliefs most often translate into emotionally driven actions. People do certain things because they strongly feel (emotion) they are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “religion” means to bind, so religious beliefs is a binding together of people with common beliefs, often translated in to emotion driven actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious and non-religious people have beliefs and emotions, removing religion isn’t going to remove those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can say religion heightens those emotions. It can and has been a method for “getting people worked up” in such a way that emotions are heightened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here too there is nothing particularly unique about religion. Dictators and Presidents, atheist and believers, have and will conduct events that heighten emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no, removing religious beliefs is not going to decrease or eliminate violence because emotions are part of who we are. Further, there will always be people who know how to manipulate emotions. Mature religion teaches us about our emotions, and helps us to know them and manage them. (Genesis 4:7) Mature religion is the antidote, not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I host an application on Amazon Lightsail, and I originally provisioned the then lowest priced instance, which cost $5 per month for 1 vCPU and 512 MB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago I determined the app needed more memory, so I decided it worth upgrading to the $10 per month, 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month Amazon released &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?fl=sp2&quot;&gt;new monthly pricing&lt;/a&gt; that lowered the price of the 1 vCPU and 1 GB instance to $5 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the one thing that I use where the cost truly decreases over time and it just happens. I did not know about the change in pricing until I got the bill for last month and saw it was lower.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Real Respect Not Displays</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t get &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html&quot;&gt;the mindset of conservatives&lt;/a&gt;. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people’s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn’t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes a country great is that people desire to move to it. People who don’t understand the irony in that sentence need to open their eyes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True greatness is neither self determined not sef proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
