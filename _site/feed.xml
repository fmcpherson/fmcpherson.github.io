&lt;p&gt;“It is no secret that culturally at this point in time, discourse has devolved to the most acute volley of “two wrongs make a right” that we may have ever historically seen. We have taken this pathological diversion to a whole other level, to the point where we are able to create impasses that are so acute, they have the appearance of being impossible to transform out of. And I wonder sometimes, when we sit in our disintegrated state, if we want to move from the impasse. The impasse itself has become like a nice comfy couch to curl up on”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that politicians do not want high voter turnout otherwise there would be a law or amendment to make election day a national holiday, or move it to a Saturday. The same applies to education in the United States. Changes have intentionally not been made because those in power benefit from the status quoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not my first smartphone, but I was a proud owner of the T-Mobile G1, the first Google phone. For me the G1 was more about the Google experience than the hardware. I’ve always felt that Google’s Internet first, information first approach aligned better to my needs than Apple’s end user experience first, hardware design first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Kavanaugh most likely will withdraw himself as candidate at the urging of the Republicans or Trump. They have plenty of alternatives who will enable their agenda equally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, they could go through the process to make it all look nice and approve him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/&quot;&gt;the new Shortcuts app&lt;/a&gt; and so far see some good and some not so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good: I created a Siri Shortcut that turns on Do Not Disturb until a time I specify and the launches the Kindle app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so good: I’ve created a Siri Shortcut for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/extensions/sharing-and-actions/&quot;&gt;action extension&lt;/a&gt; workflow I have that shares the current web page in Safari as a link formatted in markdown. What I want to do is open a page in Safari, evoke Siri and say “share this page” however once Siri starts Safari is not accessible so the web page and URL cannot be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was hoping Siri Shortcuts would understand the context of what is on screen, but it cannot because once you launch Siri she has focus. As far as I can tell, you have to use the share extension to do what I am trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a possibility for &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/&quot;&gt;Siri shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; to be a really big hit for Apple, and Google needs to beef up Assistant to match. Over time I expect Siri to speed up how you use your iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, right now I can tell Siri to open my blog and she starts Safari and opens this site. That saves me several taps. Right now I just made a shortcut to send text that I copy to the clipboard to Drafts. Highlight, copy to clipboard and then tell Siri to send this to Drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is just with the built-in functionality, soon I will be able to “program” my own shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Keep An Eye On The Watch</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the smart watch market is fascinating. On one hand you have Apple, with one design and software innovation and on the other hand you have a multitude of watch designers producing a variety of different looking watches at different price points using comparatively mediocre Wear OS. It also highlights the advantage of designing your own chips because Wear OS has been constrained by slow chip development by Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, if one is in the market for a Wear OS watch, wait until when watches with the new chips release later this year, early next. I know a number of new watches are being released to coincide with the new version of Wear OS coming next month, but I expect the new chip to provide better battery life and processing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/14/ive-factory-reset.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday I did&lt;/a&gt; a factory reset of my Fossil Q Explorist watch in the hope I would see improved battery life. So far I have had success. Before the reset the watch consumed 15% battery in an hour, today so far my watch has only consumed 7% in two hours. I only have a minimal set of apps on the watch, but I really think the problem occurred when I upgraded my phone to Android Pie. Moral is to do a reset upon such upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve factory reset &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossil.com/us/en/products/gen-3-smartwatch-q-explorist-luggage-leather-sku-FTW4004P.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwuO3cBRAyEiwAzOxKsi94BGhVSDK_JrykDn_BN5wCumApf4cobXA-rx4hByuSfhADR5oQJxoCBikQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;cid=pds:conv:google:PLA:Prospecting:ListingAds:Watches:PriorityTerms&amp;amp;ef_id=W1IqXQAABXHzfe4i:20180914202955:s&quot;&gt;my Fossil Q&lt;/a&gt; and it seems to be drawing less power, but I’ll need to watch it more over time. I am reminded that I believe this happened when I last upgraded Android my phone, when that is done something seems to happen to the Bluetooth communication between watch and phone. The solution is to break the pair, which results in a factor reset of the watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moore’s Law of Politics holds that technology slows our aging, but we remain set in our ways. The way you thought when you were a kid likely determines how you vote today, and as we age our memories get longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our country, and our planet, continue careening toward disaster, poised between the pull of Moore’s Law and the pushback of Moore’s Law of Politics. The balance is finely drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am wearing a Fossil Q Explorist, third generation. Battery life has been good enough to get through my day up until recently. It’s hard to get solid evidence because the Wear OS app does not provide much useful info on power drainers. It feels as though the problem started when upgrading my Pixel 2 to Android P. Doing a factory resert and re-pair to see if that fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While you can configure the Gmail app to use the same categories as Inbox, Gmail does not have a simple way to archive all messages in a category. For example, I want to see all Updates, scan through the list, and quickly archive them after I’ve read what I want to read. Gmail also does not have a button to snooze a message, but at least you can configure one of the two swipe actions to snooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ack! Just realize that when I implemented categories (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums) in the Gmail app on my phone, that changes the web version of Gmail too. Worse, there is no single button way to archive all email of a category. You first have to select all messages and then buttons appear to mark read, archive, delete, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Google, give me an easy way to archive all email in a category in Gmail and I will be unaffected by the demise of Inbox. Think about how fast it is to triage email in Inbox and enable that same capability in Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Really disappointed by the news that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17848500/google-inbox-shut-down-sunset-snooze-email-march-2019&quot;&gt;Google will be shutting down Inbox&lt;/a&gt;. I think it is the best email app for smartphones because it makes it real easy to triage email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not surprised by the news, we saw this coming and I’ve been using the Gmail app on desktop and tablets and Inbox on my Pixel and iPad Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Right To Not Be Forgotten</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web’s permanence, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten&quot;&gt;European Union even has a law&lt;/a&gt; in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html&quot;&gt;Dave currently thinks&lt;/a&gt; Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Dave’s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Human beings were so charmed by the illusion of control Newton’s metaphor offered that we began to see ourselves as machines too. Believing that Newton told us the truth about how the world works, we modeled our institutions on atomistic principles.
…
Our “God view” came to resemble our worldview. In this century, even much of our practical theology has also become mechanical and atomistic. Walk into many churches and you will hear God described as a being who behaves almost as predictably as Newton’s universe. Say you believe in God and you will be saved.  Sin against God and you will be condemned. Say you are sorry and you will be forgiven.  Obey the law and you will be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
