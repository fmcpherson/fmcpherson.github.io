        <description>&lt;p&gt;Does owning your own domain = owning your content? I am not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/amp/story/2018/08/14/americas-newspapers-just-played-right-into-trumps-hands-219360?utm_source=API+Need+to+Know+newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=298c4fe52c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_15_12_12&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e3bf78af04-298c4fe52c-34806089&amp;amp;__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;The plan&lt;/a&gt; by several newspapers across the country to all write editorials on the same day intended to rebut Trump’s claim that the press is the enemy of the people is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the press needs to just do its job. One thing that I do think might be helpful is to point out that every president has issues with the press, they likely can produce past video of democrat and republican presidents taking issue with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the thing, in this context, &lt;strong&gt;the President of the United States is not “the people.”&lt;/strong&gt; Consequently, a press that does NOT explicitly agree with the President is NOT an enemy of the people, if anything they may be an enemy of the President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump promotes the idea that he is just “one of us.” He, like all Presidents before him, is not just one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President serves us, and the Congress, the Supreme Court and yes, the Press, are the institutions identified by the founders of our country as being responsible to make sure the President serves faithfully by upholding his oath. By definition this means that when a person takes the oath of President of the United States, that person ceases being just one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always neat to read the story behind a favorite product. I am happy that Evernote has seemed to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

The worst thing that has happened  in the last 30 years is the general belief that it is wrong to change one’s mind, particularly if one is viewed as a leader. A real leader knows they always can learn, and therefore can always be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is important for you to know what you believe, but it is more important for you to ask yourself regularly, “Why do I believe what I believe?”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a long time user of Evernote, my first note was created in March 2008, but I have experience with that the original Windows app &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90216018/inside-evernotes-brain&quot;&gt;described in this article&lt;/a&gt;. My main attraction to Evernote has been how its purpose aligns to how I view personal computing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most political decisions are being made based on emotions and not fact because emotion-based decision making has been taught to us by media ever since the first advertisement. The Internet is optimized for advertising and therefore emotion. And at the end of day, every opinion expressed on the Internet, including this one, is advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675232/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey-free-speech&quot;&gt;the problem with articles like this one&lt;/a&gt; from the Verge about free speech and social networks is that they don’t get to the root cause, which are the conclusions and decisions people are making based on what they hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there is no skepticism applied when one is telling another what they want to hear. When a politician holds a rally for their base, does anyone attending that rally ask themselves why the event is being held? What is the purpose? Is that I am being told true, or simply being said to earn my support.&lt;/p&gt;

I believe single-payer is the best method but most of the population in the United States has been convinced otherwise by the health industry, which will lose money under single payer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am re-thinking how I use tabs in my browser, and experimenting with the idea of only keeping one tab open at a time. Old school, but perhaps more focused.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-location-tracking-turn-it-off-for-real/&quot;&gt;Pro tip&lt;/a&gt;: If you do not want your location tracked, do not have on your person something that contains a radio, like a smartphone. Otherwise, always assume that your whereabouts can be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People managed to survive hundreds, neigh thousands, of years without carrying a smartphone every where they go. You can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Micro.blog Wish</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/frankm&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more “professional.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don’t make sense for those audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it’s a write once experience meaning that edits don’t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn’t a mechanism to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Would you buy a smartphone specifically because it could also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17675072/galaxy-note-smartphone-software-feature-history-computer&quot;&gt;serve as your desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;? History shows such solutions have not worked well because there are too many compromises. In my opinion high performance wireless video is the missing ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t come to micro.blog because I was leaving somewhere else, consequently I don’t see it as an alternative to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2018/08/08/the_public_square&quot;&gt;inessential: The Public Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear calling the web a public square, thinking that is is truly open, is a myth. All of the infrastructure upon which the web runs is owned by corporations. The technology upon which the web is built is intended to be open, but they are under control of corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations pushed the web towards HTML5 in support of apps that they utlimately control. Corporations own the browsers that we use and with coding changes can force all of use towards a direction they want. The network infrastructure upon which the packets ride are owned by corporations who can, and have, allowed governments to capture and review those packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can host content on a web server running in your house. What happens when Comcast or AT&amp;amp;T decides to not sell Internet access to you? What happens when the coporations that control DNS remove your domain from their servers, or direct requests somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is truly open. All of it is at risk if it does not serve coporate interests. Right now the best we have are degrees of openness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17663494/microsoft-surface-go-review-specs-performance&quot;&gt;the reviews&lt;/a&gt; that I have read about the Surface Go have been positive. First, I note that all reviews are of the high-end, 8 GB model. Second, I can’t help but feel that everyone is desperate for a competitor to the iPad and therefore will praise up any attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the main issue is price. At a minimum Microsoft should be bundling the keyboard with the device at the price of that $650 price. I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand. If you just consume content you can live without the keyboard and stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using Instapaper because Pocket charges to highlight text. Now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.instapaper.com/post/176732408411&quot;&gt;Instapaper plans to charge $30 a year for notes&lt;/a&gt;, I need to decide whether I want to stay or switch back to Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://palash.tk/Start-Photography-With-Android&quot;&gt;good suggestions here&lt;/a&gt; of alternatives to the Camera app that you find on your Android phone. I confess that I don’t think much about the pictures that I take, I just use the build-in camera and upload to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do we still know what parts of the Internet are the public’s and which part is the corporations? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet&quot;&gt;The Internet began as a U.S. Department of Defense project&lt;/a&gt;, funded by taxpayers and therefore owned by the public. At a minimum that part of the Internet should be open with free speech protections, but can we even find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our unwillingness to create new utilities, owned and protected by the government (too much like socialism) is to our detriment. Government should do more than spend billions on defense and enable corporate owners to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have built myself a remote Linux Ubuntu/XFCE session using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.io/2018/08/05/building-an-ultimate-remote-linux-workstation/&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; and a VM I created at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudatcost.com&quot;&gt;CloudAtClost&lt;/a&gt;. The VM I created had 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM and runs pretty well, at least for text entry and email processing. Now, if only I could find a working X2GO client for iOS, the one in the app store does not run on my iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
