        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-location-tracking-turn-it-off-for-real/&quot;&gt;Pro tip&lt;/a&gt;: If you do not want your location tracked, do not have on your person something that contains a radio, like a smartphone. Otherwise, always assume that your whereabouts can be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People managed to survive hundreds, neigh thousands, of years without carrying a smartphone every where they go. You can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Micro.blog Wish</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/frankm&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more “professional.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don’t make sense for those audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it’s a write once experience meaning that edits don’t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn’t a mechanism to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Would you buy a smartphone specifically because it could also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17675072/galaxy-note-smartphone-software-feature-history-computer&quot;&gt;serve as your desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;? History shows such solutions have not worked well because there are too many compromises. In my opinion high performance wireless video is the missing ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t come to micro.blog because I was leaving somewhere else, consequently I don’t see it as an alternative to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2018/08/08/the_public_square&quot;&gt;inessential: The Public Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear calling the web a public square, thinking that is is truly open, is a myth. All of the infrastructure upon which the web runs is owned by corporations. The technology upon which the web is built is intended to be open, but they are under control of corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations pushed the web towards HTML5 in support of apps that they utlimately control. Corporations own the browsers that we use and with coding changes can force all of use towards a direction they want. The network infrastructure upon which the packets ride are owned by corporations who can, and have, allowed governments to capture and review those packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can host content on a web server running in your house. What happens when Comcast or AT&amp;amp;T decides to not sell Internet access to you? What happens when the coporations that control DNS remove your domain from their servers, or direct requests somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is truly open. All of it is at risk if it does not serve coporate interests. Right now the best we have are degrees of openness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17663494/microsoft-surface-go-review-specs-performance&quot;&gt;the reviews&lt;/a&gt; that I have read about the Surface Go have been positive. First, I note that all reviews are of the high-end, 8 GB model. Second, I can’t help but feel that everyone is desperate for a competitor to the iPad and therefore will praise up any attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the main issue is price. At a minimum Microsoft should be bundling the keyboard with the device at the price of that $650 price. I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand. If you just consume content you can live without the keyboard and stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using Instapaper because Pocket charges to highlight text. Now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.instapaper.com/post/176732408411&quot;&gt;Instapaper plans to charge $30 a year for notes&lt;/a&gt;, I need to decide whether I want to stay or switch back to Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://palash.tk/Start-Photography-With-Android&quot;&gt;good suggestions here&lt;/a&gt; of alternatives to the Camera app that you find on your Android phone. I confess that I don’t think much about the pictures that I take, I just use the build-in camera and upload to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do we still know what parts of the Internet are the public’s and which part is the corporations? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet&quot;&gt;The Internet began as a U.S. Department of Defense project&lt;/a&gt;, funded by taxpayers and therefore owned by the public. At a minimum that part of the Internet should be open with free speech protections, but can we even find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our unwillingness to create new utilities, owned and protected by the government (too much like socialism) is to our detriment. Government should do more than spend billions on defense and enable corporate owners to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have built myself a remote Linux Ubuntu/XFCE session using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.io/2018/08/05/building-an-ultimate-remote-linux-workstation/&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; and a VM I created at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudatcost.com&quot;&gt;CloudAtClost&lt;/a&gt;. The VM I created had 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM and runs pretty well, at least for text entry and email processing. Now, if only I could find a working X2GO client for iOS, the one in the app store does not run on my iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-9-pie/&quot;&gt;Google has formally released Android 9&lt;/a&gt;, which will informally be known as Android Pie (P is for Pie). The nanny, otherwise known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/&quot;&gt;Digital Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, will launch in the fall. I am not surprised by the release as the beta I have been running has been very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought this weekend I had my first fatality due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/07/26/ive-been-running.html&quot;&gt;upgrading my Pixel 2 to Android P&lt;/a&gt;. The Starbucks app on my phone lost my login information and I couldn’t get it to signin. It took me a day to contemplate the issue before I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app, which fixed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Behold, America, a fascinating new look at “the entangled history” of “America First” and “the American Dream,” out this fall, Sarah Churchwell unearths a 1900 editorial in the New York Post fretting about how multimillionaires “are very rarely, if ever, content with a position of equality.” The paper hypothesized that “the American dream,” a term not yet in common parlance, could be ended by their greed. A similar 1908 editorial in the Leavenworth, Kansas, Times, again invoking “American dreams,” championed “the equitable distribution of wealth” while making pointed note of the vast discrepancy between the pay of an insurance-company executive and a headmaster: “Why do we accord highest place to money mongers and lowest place to teachers of ideals?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running Android P on my Pixel 2 for a couple of weeks and I have not had any problems with it. I also think it is an iterative improvement on Oreo, meaning that if you don’t have It you aren’t necessarily missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/24/every-new-android-p-feature-weve-found-far-continuously-updated/&quot;&gt;Android Police has a complete rundown&lt;/a&gt; of all the new things. Oddly, my favorite may be the charging sound, as I have had cases when I thought I was charging my phone when I wasn’t because the charger was completely plugged in.  The cleaned up settings and notifications are nice, and the navigation improvements are ok but not amazing. I am still looking for significant improvement in battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am pretty much following &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;, hosting my content with domains I own on either &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, and syndicating that content to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/frankm&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjmnotes.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with this approach is that syndication only occurs once. If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.&lt;/p&gt;
