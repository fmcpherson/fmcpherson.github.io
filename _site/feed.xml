        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t get the need for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&quot;&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. There is already a section for Podcasts in Google Play Music that I have been using and have subscriptions. Google Podcasts isn’t even smart enough to import my existing subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t listen to many podcasts any more now that I don’t spend an hour a day in the car commuting to an office.  In fact, most of my recent podcast listening has been using Apple’s Podcast app on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am curious to know whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-android-messages-for-web-is-here-this-is-how-it-lets-you-text-from-pcs-macs&quot;&gt;the new web messenging feature of Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; will work in a browser on an iPad. I’ve been using Pushbullet for this type of remote texting, and that works well from an Android tablet or Windows PC, but the iOS version of Pushbullet does not support SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I know what happened. With previous posts I published from Ulysses I did not enable markdown in the publishing dialog and therefore the publisher converted the markdown to HTML so it appeared correct in Wordpress. In the previous post I enabled markdown, and since Wordpress was not configured to use markdown it did not render properly. So, to have enabled markdown in the writing settings of the WP-Admin console, which fixed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words…. operator error! :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just published &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-narthex.org/2018/06/16/daryl-madden-unlearn/&quot;&gt;a post on one of my Wordpress blogs&lt;/a&gt; using Ulysses for iOS, which I have used to publish before, and for some reason the markdown for hyperlinks was not properly recognized. Does anyone know if something has changed with Wordpress?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is really disappointing that Apple removed all handwriting recognition keyboards for iOS. I would really like to be able to use the Apple Pencil in all of apps, which I should be able to at least do with a HWR keyboard. It looks like MyScript Stack and Stylus were all removed from the store.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Overthrow Will Not Be By Force.</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don’t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don’t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mondaynote.com/ios-macos-what-no-actually-means-90b9fb2c46c7&quot;&gt;Apple’s plans for running iOS apps on MacOS&lt;/a&gt; looks very similar to Google’s running Android apps on ChromeOS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/topic/arc/input-compatibility&quot;&gt;Google is providing for mouse support in Android apps&lt;/a&gt;, which makes me wonder why Apple couldn’t add mouse support to iOS on iPads? There isn’t sa technical reason, I suspect it’s all about preserving Macs, assuming lack of mouse support in iOS is strong impediment to using iOS for productivity work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish there was such a thing as insertion point actions on my personal devices, here is what I mean. If I am adding a task in &lt;a href=&quot;https://noteplan.co/&quot;&gt;Noteplan&lt;/a&gt; on my iPad to call a friend, it would be really cool to just tap and hold, to get an Actions menu, from which I see an option that says “Add link to a contact.”  A link would be pasted at the current location of the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like Drafts, but I think the concept behind it is nonsensical. The idea of Drafts is that you use it to write and edit any text that you can then send to other apps, which also have the capability to write and edit text. So, you see “actions” in Drafts for entering tasks in apps like OmniFocus and Todoist, but why is that easier than just entering information in Microblog, OmniFocus and Todoist? It seems to me that people who use iOS for productivity are so enamored by the workflows they have created they don’t seem to realize the workflows are basically workarounds for deficiencies that existed in previous versions of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding the number of iOS apps that basically do the same thing insane! Really, how many markdown editors are needed?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen much written about this, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/211/&quot;&gt;it looks to me like Siri Shortcuts is the new Workflow&lt;/a&gt;. Will Workflow as we now know it go away to be replaced by the Siri Shortcuts app? It’s ironic that Apple aquired an app, Workflow, to make another app it aquired, Siri, more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the root of &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-narthex.org/2018/05/30/the-importance-of-god-theology/&quot;&gt;bad theology &lt;/a&gt; is the focus on the problem, sin, rather than on how things are supposed to be, oneness. If sin is separation from God, then racism is really the modern label for original sin. We are all connected and we are meant to see ourselves as connected to each other and God.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tolerance Is Fundamental To Freedom</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;The Bill Gates Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all platforms ultimately end up being commoditized? I see companies like Google and Facebook striving to not be like the personal computer or Windows, so I suspect they choose to be aggregators to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that few, if any, reviews of notes apps like Bear don’t address security.  Can you encrypt the content you put in the app? How easy is that encryption? Can you encrypt entire notes? Notebooks? Or just snippets of text? And who holds the keys?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like a Firefox extension that takes grabs the title of a web page and the URL of that web page, puts that into a Markdown link format and stores to the clipboard for pasting into the micro.blog web input box. In the past I have used applets for linking to web pages in my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking if Chromebook manufacturers expect people to be using Linux apps, wouldn’t they provide storage options greater than 64 GB? I find the news about Linux support on Chromebooks intriguing enough for me to consider purchasing a new one once the feature is widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a democracy the leader does not dictate behavior, that is called dictatorship. The fact that Trump does not get the fundamentals of democracy is scary, and the fact that we elected such a person President is very disappointing. The fact that so many people do not see this as an issue is frightening, and a sign that our democracy may already be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of weeks I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://noteplan.co/&quot;&gt;NotePlan&lt;/a&gt;, and I think what I like most about it is that you end up with a daily log of what you did. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foldingtext.com/&quot;&gt;FoldingText&lt;/a&gt; looks like a similarly useful tool, but not available on iOS, but I like outliners. The feature I want in an outliner is simple linking both with an outline file and to external items.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chrome OS’ forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-apps-chrome-os-overview-crostini/&quot;&gt;ability to run Linux apps&lt;/a&gt; appears to me to mostly be something Google did so that their engineers could actually use the Pixelbook. Once that feature is seen in the code you might as well let the broad developer community in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited. Right now I can only think one app I will want to run in such a container and that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardnotes.org&quot;&gt;Standard Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A credit card company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17071478/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android&quot;&gt;robot keeps calling my smart phone&lt;/a&gt; and neither Google nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nomorobo&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; is able to catch it because each call is from a different number and often local. Right now, if caller ID doesn’t show something I recognize, I don’t answer the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think we need to outlaw phone calling robots, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335710/google-duplex-phone-call-ai-assistant-service-industry&quot;&gt;Google Duplex&lt;/a&gt; gets entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drafts or Ulysses?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org&quot;&gt;one site&lt;/a&gt; that only has a “basic” web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it doesn’t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.&lt;/p&gt;

It is going to take time for the leather to break in, so the race is between the breakin of the leather or me.&lt;/p&gt;
