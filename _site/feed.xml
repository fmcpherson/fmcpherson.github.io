&lt;p&gt;To Republicans complaining about partisanship I simply ask what is possibility more partisan than not even having a hearing on a SCOTUS nominee simply because the president is a Democrat? You have no integrity to make any such complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The pervasive belief that girls and women just make stuff up about sexual assult is what enables it to happen in the first place. It’s a belief perpetuated by boys and men to maintain their power. What is occuring right now is men in power maintaining their power. It’s not about right or wrong. It’s not about democracy or governing, it’s all about privilege and power and getting what one wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what you see on your TV screen, that’s a reflection of yourself. The problem isn’t that it’s happening, the problem is that you are ok with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.castlechurchbrewing.com/blog/why-its-pointless-to-preach-about-morals?utm_source=Castle+Church+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=18abb70072-CASTLE+CHURCH+Weekly+Summary&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_8ea6a897f0-18abb70072-228238469&amp;amp;mc_cid=18abb70072&amp;amp;mc_eid=dd26c2cf1c#/&quot;&gt;Why It’s Pointless to Preach about Morals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We base everything from our private morality to our public policies and every major value in between on this nebulous thing called “rights.”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there are some issues with basing everything on rights. For one, they’ve tended to be negatively defined. “I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This negative definition of rights is what inspired an entire book by the great 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer reflecting on the culture shock of his time spent teaching in New York. He was puzzled that we Americans seem to talk a lot about what we are “free from,” but hardly anyone ever brings up what we might be “free for.” Yes, there are all these things which we don’t want to infringe upon our lives. But what are we living for? What positive thing should we be seeking to enrich and improve our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is no secret that culturally at this point in time, discourse has devolved to the most acute volley of “two wrongs make a right” that we may have ever historically seen. We have taken this pathological diversion to a whole other level, to the point where we are able to create impasses that are so acute, they have the appearance of being impossible to transform out of. And I wonder sometimes, when we sit in our disintegrated state, if we want to move from the impasse. The impasse itself has become like a nice comfy couch to curl up on”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that politicians do not want high voter turnout otherwise there would be a law or amendment to make election day a national holiday, or move it to a Saturday. The same applies to education in the United States. Changes have intentionally not been made because those in power benefit from the status quoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not my first smartphone, but I was a proud owner of the T-Mobile G1, the first Google phone. For me the G1 was more about the Google experience than the hardware. I’ve always felt that Google’s Internet first, information first approach aligned better to my needs than Apple’s end user experience first, hardware design first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Kavanaugh most likely will withdraw himself as candidate at the urging of the Republicans or Trump. They have plenty of alternatives who will enable their agenda equally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, they could go through the process to make it all look nice and approve him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/&quot;&gt;the new Shortcuts app&lt;/a&gt; and so far see some good and some not so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good: I created a Siri Shortcut that turns on Do Not Disturb until a time I specify and the launches the Kindle app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so good: I’ve created a Siri Shortcut for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/extensions/sharing-and-actions/&quot;&gt;action extension&lt;/a&gt; workflow I have that shares the current web page in Safari as a link formatted in markdown. What I want to do is open a page in Safari, evoke Siri and say “share this page” however once Siri starts Safari is not accessible so the web page and URL cannot be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was hoping Siri Shortcuts would understand the context of what is on screen, but it cannot because once you launch Siri she has focus. As far as I can tell, you have to use the share extension to do what I am trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a possibility for &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/&quot;&gt;Siri shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; to be a really big hit for Apple, and Google needs to beef up Assistant to match. Over time I expect Siri to speed up how you use your iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, right now I can tell Siri to open my blog and she starts Safari and opens this site. That saves me several taps. Right now I just made a shortcut to send text that I copy to the clipboard to Drafts. Highlight, copy to clipboard and then tell Siri to send this to Drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is just with the built-in functionality, soon I will be able to “program” my own shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Keep An Eye On The Watch</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the smart watch market is fascinating. On one hand you have Apple, with one design and software innovation and on the other hand you have a multitude of watch designers producing a variety of different looking watches at different price points using comparatively mediocre Wear OS. It also highlights the advantage of designing your own chips because Wear OS has been constrained by slow chip development by Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, if one is in the market for a Wear OS watch, wait until when watches with the new chips release later this year, early next. I know a number of new watches are being released to coincide with the new version of Wear OS coming next month, but I expect the new chip to provide better battery life and processing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/14/ive-factory-reset.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday I did&lt;/a&gt; a factory reset of my Fossil Q Explorist watch in the hope I would see improved battery life. So far I have had success. Before the reset the watch consumed 15% battery in an hour, today so far my watch has only consumed 7% in two hours. I only have a minimal set of apps on the watch, but I really think the problem occurred when I upgraded my phone to Android Pie. Moral is to do a reset upon such upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

I am reminded that I believe this happened when I last upgraded Android my phone, when that is done something seems to happen to the Bluetooth communication between watch and phone. The solution is to break the pair, which results in a factor reset of the watch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our country, and our planet, continue careening toward disaster, poised between the pull of Moore’s Law and the pushback of Moore’s Law of Politics. The balance is finely drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am wearing a Fossil Q Explorist, third generation. Battery life has been good enough to get through my day up until recently. It’s hard to get solid evidence because the Wear OS app does not provide much useful info on power drainers. It feels as though the problem started when upgrading my Pixel 2 to Android P. Doing a factory resert and re-pair to see if that fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;
