        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am confused about the value of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/pixel-3-price-google-hands-on&quot;&gt;the new Call Screen feature&lt;/a&gt; that Google plans to add to Pixel phones. I assume the primary purpose is to screen telemarketing calls, but doesn’t the very act of answering the call provide a signal that the number is valid? I was under the impression the best thing to do with telemarketing is to not answer the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, if I get a call that I don’t recognize, which is most, I decline the call. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the reaction would have been if Obama had campaigned as much as Trump does. Pretty sure Fox News would be all over it. And I wonder how much I as a taxpayer am paying for these campaign events.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It must frustrate Detroit Tiger fans to see so many former Tigers in the MLB Playoffs. The Red Sox have three former Tigers playing for them in this game against the Yankees. Not to mention the Red Sox GM, who used to be the Tiger’s GM and then you have Justin Verlander over on the Astros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the it will be Red Sox vs. Astros in the ALCS, with Dodgers vs. Brewers in the NLCS. Both will be good series.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am also not thrilled by the $799 starting price on the Pixel 3. I paid $649 for the Pixel 2, and wasn’t entirely thrilled by that price. Given my use of tablets I have a hard time justifying paying more than $650 for a smartphone. Sadly, Pixel 2 may be my last Pixel phone at this pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;First reaction to the #madebygoogle event. Meh. I think the Pixel Slate is DOA with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate_specs&quot;&gt;starting price&lt;/a&gt; of $599 for a 4GB RAM 32 GB storage tablet when one can by an iPad with 128 GB of storage for $429. The lowest price iPad Pro is $649, which is cheaper than a comparable Pixel Slate priced at $799.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these prices and how the compare with iPad, I don’t understand why Google is even bothering with a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Flickr Pro account is coming up for renewal and I am wrestling over whether to renew it. The cost has doubled since I first signed up and I don’t think I get double the value. On the other hand, I’ve used Flickr for more than a decade and there is a part of me that wants to see it continue. If the price had remained the same, I don’t think I would be having this internal debate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/inside-the-unlikely-movement-that-could-restore-voting-rights-to-1-4-million-floridians/&quot;&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The issue made national headlines in 2000, when Republican officials in Florida alleged that thousands of people with felony records were illegally registered to vote and needed to be removed from the rolls. African Americans made up only 11 percent of registered voters in the state but 44 percent of those on the purge list, which turned out to be riddled with errors. After the election, the state conceded that 12,000 eligible voters had been wrongly labeled as ex-felons and barred from voting. That was 22 times George W. Bush’s 537-vote margin of victory over Al Gore in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active voter suppression and the result.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-pixel-slate-images-keyboard-cover-specifications-nocturne/&quot;&gt;fair amount of excitement&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of a possible Google tablet being announced tomorrow. The tablet will run the latest iteration of Chrome OS that runs Android and Linux apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google does not have a tablet in its hardware lineup, so I understand it feels it has an opportunity to provide an alternative to the iPad. However, I am a bit skeptical about the potential for success. I think Apple may have what little there is of the tablet market sown up with the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixel-slate-nocturne-intel-configurations-celeron-m3-i5-i7/&quot;&gt;there could be four different models&lt;/a&gt; of the Google tablet, no doubt to address different price points. I am interested to see what will be the lowest price for the tablet and how much functionality it will provide.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One way to trump the Supreme Court is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)&quot;&gt;ratify amendments to the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It clearly has been a problem, but it is also about the 2nd spot. When the Cubs have had success it has been due to the catalyst in the 1 and 2 spots in the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the Kavanaugh confirmation does not represent the will of the people but rather the will of the Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Kavanaugh will obviously not be “impartial” as an umpire is not surprising and not the real problem. The real problem is that the people supporting Kavanaugh do not want him to be impartial, they want and fully expect him to make decisions along their party ideological lines. Our institutions are reflections of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/my_horrible_right_wing_past_confessions_of_a_one_time_religious_right_icon/&quot;&gt;White Christian America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their anti-abortion commitment to evangelicals, and in turn we’d vote for them — by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, “we” would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the sake of the above, White Christian America gave up its integrity and moral authority, and it wonders why unaffliated is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/&quot;&gt;the fastest rising religion&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s probably time to stop evaluating this in terms of talent and start evaluating it in terms of production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, exactly! Looking forward on the conclusions and actions taken as a result of such an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This gets at how it is privacy regulations in particular go wrong: in the attempt to make rules that protect people without their agency, those wishing to take said agency cannot even know what exactly Facebook knows about them because, well, privacy. Meanwhile, websites throw up pop-ups and overlays that no one reads, or ban entire continents, not because their users care but because a regulator said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Civics Lesson</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, one needs to learn what history says it means to be an American. Next, one needs to decide what they believe it means to be an American. How consistent are your beliefs with history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Next, one needs to determine what each political party claims it stands for and challenge the assumptions for how those claims are consistent with being an American and for progress. 
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, the questions of whether progress is needed, desired, and how it looks needs to be decided, ultimately by each individual. 
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the Republican’s point of view, the credibility of the Supreme Court and the sanctity of the Constitution is not what is at stake. What is at stake is putting in permanent place Supreme Court justices that support only their ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple problem we have is that nobody in positions of Power in this country, be they elected officials, corporations, or oligarchs, are factoring consequences in to their decisions. The only consequence they do fear is not getting their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point you might have been able to say they these people are simply doing what they thinks is best for the United States and that there can be different approaches toward the same ends. I no longer believe this to be true, the ultimate motivation is staying in power and satisfying the people responsible for that power.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;How much do the Trump rallys cost the U.S. taxpayer? We are definitely paying for the secret service and police protection, what about the transportation and all other accommodations? You can say the same thing about every weekend trip to his golf courses and resorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company’s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it occurs to me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html&quot;&gt;my analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Cub’s performance in last year’s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer’s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.&lt;/p&gt;
