        <description>&lt;p&gt;For me, the conversation feature of the micro.blog apps is what makes it stand apart from other social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planting A Garden</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/&quot;&gt;The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from “regular” web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by “the garden.” With that paradigm, I created two “projects”, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html&quot;&gt;which Chromebook I was going to buy&lt;/a&gt; and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html&quot;&gt;my experience with using the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://testing.frankmcpherson.net&quot;&gt;I have been dabbling with wikis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html&quot;&gt;my Pixelbook page&lt;/a&gt; with a section about running Android and Linux apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One annoying thing about running Android apps on the Pixelbook is caused by weather apps that continually display a notification and thus the Pixelbook always show that I have one notification to display. There should be a setting to tell Chrome OS to not count these apps for the notification count.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/639702?hl=en&quot;&gt;Wear OS H Update Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wear OS Update H installed on my watch two days ago. There appears to be a problem recovering from the new “deep sleep” / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this “feature?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I’ve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single worse SCOTUS ruling of my life time is Citzens United. If Congress were serious about doing things that truly benefit us they would pass legislation aimed at correcting this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/563800?hl=en&quot;&gt;The Wear OS “H” update&lt;/a&gt; arrived on my Fossil Q Explorist yesterday. I am curious to see how much battery life improves. Apparently Google has added a deep sleep mode that kicks in after 30 minutes of no activity, but I am not sure how activity is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordsandbuttons.online/fortran_is_still_a_thing.html&quot;&gt;Fortran is still a thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And as for the outdatedness, the current Fortran standard is Fortran 2008. The next one is 2018 and it is expected to arrive anytime soon. Fortran is constantly being modernized one little step after another. The biggest holding factor here is its mission. It must remain simple for real engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started college in 1984 Fortran was the language taught in the introductory programming class required by computer science and engineering students. Advanced computer science classes used Pascal. Java did not exist then.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/&quot;&gt;The Fourth National Climate Change Assessment&lt;/a&gt; was published by the POTUS administration on Black Friday. Why they waited until then rather than on a day of an Apple announcement is beyond me. Go read it while it is still on the web and before POTUS has it taken down, because he doesn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not having a good fantasy football day. To of my key key players, Brandon Cooks and Tyreek Hill, have a bye, so I was filling the gaps and hoping for the best. My decision to start Duke Johnson over Chris Carson has not been good. Worse, Leonard Fournette got ejected from the game, so I can’t count om him to expand his team leading points.&lt;/p&gt;
