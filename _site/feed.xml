        <description>&lt;p&gt;It might just be me, but it seems that Chrome is getting slower and slower. I’ve decided to start using Firefox for a while to see if the aggravation decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boycotts and Free Speech </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don’t see how in any way that infringes on a person’s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person’s ability to make money on cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being “fair and balanced” is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder, back in the day, how many articles were written to explain Facebook and Twitter to people and convince them to use it? I am thinking that if someone has to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/540623/quit-facebook-twitter/&quot;&gt;an article to explain a social network&lt;/a&gt;, it’s too complicated and will not draw lots of people. (Exhibit A: Google+)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Assistant is still flawed by not enabling users to specify unique trigger words for each device. So, I use my smartphone as an alarm clock and I thought it would be cool to enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-routines/&quot;&gt;the Bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; that turns down the phone, sets an alarm and shuts off lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is that routine is enabled for Home and my Pixel phone. So, if I initiate the routine with the two in the same room, Home takes over and then sets the alarm for itself rather than on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think Google needs to do two things. First, it should provide a way to associate specific routines to specific assistant-enabled devices. Second, it needs to provide a way for users to create trigger words that are specific to devices. Right now, I can squeeze to trigger assistant on my phone and then start the routine, but that requires me to remember this rather than assistant being smart enough to remember for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/976528016594558976&quot;&gt;This tweet&lt;/a&gt; by @inessential touches on what I think is a root of many problems in the United States. You might say the problem is immaturity, but it is worse than that, the problem is that we have de-valued maturity. Maturity is a life-long process and with it comes the wisdom to know that one does not, cannot, know everything and therefore is open to changing their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the fact that I can’t find who I am following on Micro.blog is a real gap. A tip to fill the gap is to favorite at least one post of each person you follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to take note of in the story above is the relationships between the parents and children and the teaching. Now here is the problem, not every child has such relationships or teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past we had some consensus on what is right and wrong, and at the very least agreement that right and wrong is important. The problem is right and wrong is no longer important, nor the point, instead that has been replaced with, you are either with me or against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot solve any problem if your starting position is effectively, we will solve that problem only if everyone agrees with me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the way home last night from a gathering of friends in Royal Oak, I stopped at a store and found some &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundersbrewing.com/our-beer/kbs/&quot;&gt;Founders KBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atwaterbeer.com/beer-type/berry-cobbler-ale/#&quot;&gt;Atwaters Blueberry Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; for sale. The store owner started the day with 12 cases of KBS and had 2 left by 8:30 PM and will probably be sold out by this afternoon. Right place, right time for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not excited by subtle UI design changes such as being shown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/hands-on-with-android-p-is-this-the-beginning-of-a-new-design-language/&quot;&gt;the Android P developer preview&lt;/a&gt;. What I am more interested in is substantial changes, which frankly have been few and far between in Android and iOS. I bought a Pixel 2 last year only because I knew with the release of Android O the Nexus 6P had reached the end of the line and would get no more updates. Otherwise, the 6P was and still is a great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

Constant disruption does not result in progress, it is status quo at best, and most likely regressive. In some areas, like the state department and defense, chaos can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are happy with the chaos that Trump is causing, but besides the LOLs what else are those people getting?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://standardnotes.org/&quot;&gt;Standard Notes A Simple And Private Notes App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am invested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, but if I we’re starting a fresh search for a note taking repository, I would probably go with Standard Notes. The most appealing feature is that it encrypts all notes before they are stored locally, and the encrypted copy is what is synced to their server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard Noted runs on multiple platforms, and the paid version is very extensible and supports two factor authentication. If you are inclined, you can host Standard Noted on your own server.&lt;/p&gt;

Immediately on Twitter are the gun control/anti-control fanatics tweeting away. What is always lost is context. The problem isn’t necessarily this one event, the problem is that this event is just the lastest instance of something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, all we have are advocates of each side of the solution yelling at each other so that &lt;strong&gt;nothing is being done.&lt;/strong&gt; So, from where I stand the real issue at this moment is the fact that we doing nothing but just live with the problem, which is a sign for how low our society has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In her article titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://points.datasociety.net/alternative-facts-alternative-truths-ab9d446b06c&quot;&gt;Alternative Facts, Alternative Truths&lt;/a&gt;” I think Dr. Francesca Tripodi provides a good example of the consequence of dualism as taught by fundamentalist churches. Issues like gun control, racism, and patriarchy do involve emotion as well as fact. In my opinion, just about all big decisions involve emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the matter of the Evangelical church’s view of Trump, what I think this article shows is missing is context. If all you look for are the words you like, and don’t stop to consider that the person providing them knows that and is intentionally saying them with no history to back them up, there is going to be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There Is No Such Thing As Health Insurance</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/twenty-states-sue-federal-government-seeking-end-to-obamacare-idUSKCN1GB06R&quot;&gt;Twenty states have filed suit&lt;/a&gt; against the federal government basically because there is no business model in healthcare insurance. Before we can fix problems we have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree on what is the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree that the problem needs to be fixed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that the solution to every problem (healthcare) is not a hammer called capitalism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree on fundamental principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the business model for insurance is based on the premise that a company pays out less money than it takes in through people buying insurance. Property insurance works because it is possible that people who pay for it never need to file a claim through their life time. Likewise auto insurance works because there are people who never have to file a claim over a lifetime of driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In context, there really is no such thing as health insurance because every health care transaction is paid by the “health insurance” companies and just about everyone has one or more healthcare transactions per year. In other words, how does a “health insurance” company make money? If auto insurance was like healthcare, ever time one took their car in for an oil change or a tire rotation they would file an auto insurance claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we have to stop thinking that there is a capitalistic solution to the cost of health care. Just about all other countries around the world came to this realization and did something about it. We in the United States have drunk the capitalistic koolaid so much that we have forgotten our own history and just run around trying to hammer away every single problem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the subscription model may be good for individual developers, I think it will hurt the iOS app ecosystem. I can’t afford yearly subscriptions for all the apps I have on my iPad, so I will be forced to decrease down to a smaller number.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mtu.edu/carnival/&quot;&gt;Michigan Tech’s annual Winter Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is in progress, with the snow statue competition completing this morning. I attended Tech from 1984-89 and have good Carny memories. The number of hours students put in to building these statues is incredible and the results are fantastic. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigantech/collections/72157662834921158/&quot;&gt;the photos&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a smart light bulb or plug that does not automatically turn on after a power failure? It’s frustrating me that I cannot find one that allows me to configure what I want the default state to be. Plugs seem to default to last known state while light bulbs seem to default to on.&lt;/p&gt;
