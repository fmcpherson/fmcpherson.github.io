        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a Fossil Explorist Q, which is a Wear OS smart watch, for my birthday. Today Fossil pushed a face, commemorating Earth Day, to my watch, which was unexpected. Now I am curious to learn what other faces Fossil will push. I think this is a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)&quot;&gt;Easter egg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything restored on the Pixel 2 except for the Android Wear settings, so now I have to factory reset my watches and completely reconfigure them to manage them in the Wear OS  app. What an awful user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something really bad just happened to my Pixel 2 to shut down and then not boot. I have had to do a factory reset. Now restoring from backup. I had just downloaded the NASA picture of the day and was making it the wallpaper on the phone when this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The right way for me — as well as the vast majority of the people I have coached over my years as an Evernote consultant — is by using notebooks and stacks as the primary organizing blocks of Evernote, with tags being used not as an organizational tool, but a find feature in Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used Evernote for a long time, and I use notebooks and stacks as the primary organizational method and tags to help find information. When seek information in Evernote I usually search for that information across all notes unless I expect to only find it in a certain notebook or stack.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com&quot;&gt;Drafts 5&lt;/a&gt;, purchased the yearly subscription, and I am now writing my first micro.blog post using it. Let’s see how well this works. Sent over to the micro.blog app where I can edit further. Of course, this method requires that you have the micro.blog app installed on your iPad, but you don’t have to generate a new app code for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After one day of full time usage, I am finding Firefox to be significantly faster than Chrome. One exception does seem to be with Inbox, which is heavy Javascript. I also may not have all of the Extensions installed in Firefox as I have in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boycotts and Free Speech </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don’t see how in any way that infringes on a person’s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person’s ability to make money on cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being “fair and balanced” is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder, back in the day, how many articles were written to explain Facebook and Twitter to people and convince them to use it? I am thinking that if someone has to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/540623/quit-facebook-twitter/&quot;&gt;an article to explain a social network&lt;/a&gt;, it’s too complicated and will not draw lots of people.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Assistant is still flawed by not enabling users to specify unique trigger words for each device. So, I use my smartphone as an alarm clock and I thought it would be cool to enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-routines/&quot;&gt;the Bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; that turns down the phone, sets an alarm and shuts off lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is that routine is enabled for Home and my Pixel phone. So, if I initiate the routine with the two in the same room, Home takes over and then sets the alarm for itself rather than on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think Google needs to do two things. First, it should provide a way to associate specific routines to specific assistant-enabled devices. Second, it needs to provide a way for users to create trigger words that are specific to devices. Right now, I can squeeze to trigger assistant on my phone and then start the routine, but that requires me to remember this rather than assistant being smart enough to remember for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The scariest part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/594363877/trump-names-john-bolton-as-national-security-adviser&quot;&gt;the shrinking of President Trump’s echo chamber&lt;/a&gt; is that it increases the need for Congress to do it’s part to uphold and defend the constitution by putting country before party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are closer to war today than we were yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/976528016594558976&quot;&gt;This tweet&lt;/a&gt; by @inessential touches on what I think is a root of many problems in the United States. You might say the problem is immaturity, but it is worse than that, the problem is that we have de-valued maturity. Maturity is a life-long process and with it comes the wisdom to know that one does not, cannot, know everything and therefore is open to changing their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the fact that I can’t find who I am following on Micro.blog is a real gap. A tip to fill the gap is to favorite at least one post of each person you follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to take note of in the story above is the relationships between the parents and children and the teaching. Now here is the problem, not every child has such relationships or teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To those who are smarter than me. If I don’t have a VPN tunnel from end-to-end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-outline-vpn-software/&quot;&gt;why should I use a VPN solution like the one Google is proposing&lt;/a&gt;?

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past we had some consensus on what is right and wrong, and at the very least agreement that right and wrong is important. The problem is right and wrong is no longer important, nor the point, instead that has been replaced with, you are either with me or against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot solve any problem if your starting position is effectively, we will solve that problem only if everyone agrees with me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the way home last night from a gathering of friends in Royal Oak, I stopped at a store and found some &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundersbrewing.com/our-beer/kbs/&quot;&gt;Founders KBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atwaterbeer.com/beer-type/berry-cobbler-ale/#&quot;&gt;Atwaters Blueberry Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; for sale. The store owner started the day with 12 cases of KBS and had 2 left by 8:30 PM and will probably be sold out by this afternoon. Right place, right time for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not excited by subtle UI design changes such as being shown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/hands-on-with-android-p-is-this-the-beginning-of-a-new-design-language/&quot;&gt;the Android P developer preview&lt;/a&gt;. What I am more interested in is substantial changes, which frankly have been few and far between in Android and iOS. I bought a Pixel 2 last year only because I knew with the release of Android O the Nexus 6P had reached the end of the line and would get no more updates. Otherwise, the 6P was and still is a great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

Constant disruption does not result in progress, it is status quo at best, and most likely regressive. In some areas, like the state department and defense, chaos can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are happy with the chaos that Trump is causing, but besides the LOLs what else are those people getting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am invested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, but if I we’re starting a fresh search for a note taking repository, I would probably go with Standard Notes. The most appealing feature is that it encrypts all notes before they are stored locally, and the encrypted copy is what is synced to their server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard Noted runs on multiple platforms, and the paid version is very extensible and supports two factor authentication. If you are inclined, you can host Standard Noted on your own server.&lt;/p&gt;

Immediately on Twitter are the gun control/anti-control fanatics tweeting away. What is always lost is context. The problem isn’t necessarily this one event, the problem is that this event is just the lastest instance of something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, all we have are advocates of each side of the solution yelling at each other so that &lt;strong&gt;nothing is being done.&lt;/strong&gt; So, from where I stand the real issue at this moment is the fact that we doing nothing but just live with the problem, which is a sign for how low our society has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In her article titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://points.datasociety.net/alternative-facts-alternative-truths-ab9d446b06c&quot;&gt;Alternative Facts, Alternative Truths&lt;/a&gt;” I think Dr. Francesca Tripodi provides a good example of the consequence of dualism as taught by fundamentalist churches. Issues like gun control, racism, and patriarchy do involve emotion as well as fact. In my opinion, just about all big decisions involve emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the matter of the Evangelical church’s view of Trump, what I think this article shows is missing is context. If all you look for are the words you like, and don’t stop to consider that the person providing them knows that and is intentionally saying them with no history to back them up, there is going to be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
