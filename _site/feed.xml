        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find really frustrating how inconsistent sharing works across apps with iOS. Try sharing a web page to Drafts or micro.blog and you end up with different results. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one request of Apple is to add mouse support to the iPad. Apple can look at how Windows and Android handle mouse support on touchscreens, it can’t be that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest ethical topic of our time might be that just because we &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; do something &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t mean we should do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the root of &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-narthex.org/2018/05/30/the-importance-of-god-theology/&quot;&gt;bad theology &lt;/a&gt; is the focus on the problem, sin, rather than on how things are supposed to be, oneness. If sin is separation from God, then racism is really the modern label for original sin. We are all connected and we are meant to see ourselves as connected to each other and God.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now it takes way too much work for me to share pictures on micro.blog because I use an Android phone. I take the picture using my phone, which is stored in Google Photos, then open the picture on my iPad, download it, then open the micro.blog app and add the picture to a post like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/reviews/agenda-for-ios-review/&quot;&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; about an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://agenda.com/&quot;&gt;Agenda&lt;/a&gt; that shared a name with a Personal Information Manager (PIM) that I liked back in the day called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Agenda&quot;&gt;Lotus Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tolerance Is Fundamental To Freedom</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;The Bill Gates Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all platforms ultimately end up being commoditized? I see companies like Google and Facebook striving to not be like the personal computer or Windows, so I suspect they choose to be aggregators to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that few, if any, reviews of notes apps like Bear don’t address security.  Can you encrypt the content you put in the app? How easy is that encryption? Can you encrypt entire notes? Notebooks? Or just snippets of text? And who holds the keys?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like a Firefox extension that takes grabs the title of a web page and the URL of that web page, puts that into a Markdown link format and stores to the clipboard for pasting into the micro.blog web input box. In the past I have used applets for linking to web pages in my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking if Chromebook manufacturers expect people to be using Linux apps, wouldn’t they provide storage options greater than 64 GB? I find the news about Linux support on Chromebooks intriguing enough for me to consider purchasing a new one once the feature is widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a democracy the leader does not dictate behavior, that is called dictatorship. The fact that Trump does not get the fundamentals of democracy is scary, and the fact that we elected such a person President is very disappointing. The fact that so many people do not see this as an issue is frightening, and a sign that our democracy may already be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of weeks I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://noteplan.co/&quot;&gt;NotePlan&lt;/a&gt;, and I think what I like most about it is that you end up with a daily log of what you did. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foldingtext.com/&quot;&gt;FoldingText&lt;/a&gt; looks like a similarly useful tool, but not available on iOS, but I like outliners. The feature I want in an outliner is simple linking both with an outline file and to external items.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chrome OS’ forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-apps-chrome-os-overview-crostini/&quot;&gt;ability to run Linux apps&lt;/a&gt; appears to me to mostly be something Google did so that their engineers could actually use the Pixelbook. Once that feature is seen in the code you might as well let the broad developer community in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited. Right now I can only think one app I will want to run in such a container and that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardnotes.org&quot;&gt;Standard Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, if caller ID doesn’t show something I recognize, I don’t answer the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think we need to outlaw phone calling robots, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335710/google-duplex-phone-call-ai-assistant-service-industry&quot;&gt;Google Duplex&lt;/a&gt; gets entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drafts or Ulysses?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org&quot;&gt;one site&lt;/a&gt; that only has a “basic” web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it doesn’t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used some credit card reward to discount the cost of the Pad &amp;amp; Quill case for th iPad Pro 10.5 that &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/05/03/does-anyone-have.html&quot;&gt;I wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt;. The case arrived today and it is beautiful and provides plenty of protection but also adds bulk. It is going to take time for the leather to break in, so the race is between the breakin of the leather or me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching the Cubs play the Cardinals. So far two calls have been overturned by replay. Replay is showing how bad baseball umpires are, you can almost say something like 25% of all calls made in MLB history before replay were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a recommendation on a case for the iPad Pro 10.5? I prefer a case that doesn’t add bulk, is easy to take on/off, and has a place for the Apple Pencil. I like the look of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.padandquill.com/cases-for-ipad/oxford-leather-ipad-pro-105-case.html&quot;&gt;the Pad &amp;amp; Quill Oxford case&lt;/a&gt;, but I am uncertain about the adhesive tape and how easy it is to take the case off.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Blogging versus Social Networks</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You might think it too fine a point, but I think any blogging product requires the ability to edit what one has written. To me, editing is a fundamental difference between blogging and social networks because blogging is about permanence where as the social network timeline/newsfeed is a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, what makes micro blogging different from social networks like Twitter is the permance I describe above, and therefore editing should be a fundamental requirement for all micro blogging apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google releases a new Tasks app. It is a pretty barebones list making app that at least supports sub tasks. Unfortunately the iOS version is only for the iPhone and looks awful on the iPad, even the iPad Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gmail versus Inbox</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google has released the new version of Gmail, which I am checking out. I have been using, and like, Inbox mostly because how quickly I can use it to triage email. By triage I mean browse for messages I want to read and then quickly archiving all the remaining messages. No other app, including Gmail provides as easy a way to archive a group of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of Inbox is that it is very JavaScript heavy and therefore the web app performance can suffer. Another downside is that the app versions don’t look as good on larger screens such as on my 10.5 iPad Pro in landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am considering using Gmail on large screens and Inbox on small screens. However to decide that, I need to use the new Gmail for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Did a little more investigation into &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html&quot;&gt;the watch face that Fossil “pushed” to my smart watch last weekend&lt;/a&gt;. What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you “unlocked” a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each “new face” as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use a simple process for telling whether my computer is working too hard, I listen for the fan. By this simple measure I determined that Chrome was just killing my computer and checking Process Explorer I did see high CPU utilization. I switched to Firefox as my primary browser and so far the fan has been quiet and the browser more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/&quot;&gt;Amazon Lightsail&lt;/a&gt; to host the Dockerized version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monicahq.com/&quot;&gt;a CRM application&lt;/a&gt;. There has just been a major release and the latest version of the Docker image is not working for me. I take snapshots of the server as a back up, so I was able to revert back to the prior version of the server pretty easily. The process does involve creating a new instance from a snapshot, moving the public IP address to the new instance, and then deleting the old instance.&lt;/p&gt;
