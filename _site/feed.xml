        <description>&lt;p&gt;One way to trump the Supreme Court is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)&quot;&gt;ratify amendments to the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It clearly has been a problem, but it is also about the 2nd spot. When the Cubs have had success it has been due to the catalyst in the 1 and 2 spots in the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the Kavanaugh confirmation does not represent the will of the people but rather the will of the Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Kavanaugh will obviously not be “impartial” as an umpire is not surprising and not the real problem. The real problem is that the people supporting Kavanaugh do not want him to be impartial, they want and fully expect him to make decisions along their party ideological lines. Our institutions are reflections of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/my_horrible_right_wing_past_confessions_of_a_one_time_religious_right_icon/&quot;&gt;White Christian America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their anti-abortion commitment to evangelicals, and in turn we’d vote for them — by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, “we” would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the sake of the above, White Christian America gave up its integrity and moral authority, and it wonders why unaffliated is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/&quot;&gt;the fastest rising religion&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s probably time to stop evaluating this in terms of talent and start evaluating it in terms of production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, exactly! Looking forward on the conclusions and actions taken as a result of such an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This gets at how it is privacy regulations in particular go wrong: in the attempt to make rules that protect people without their agency, those wishing to take said agency cannot even know what exactly Facebook knows about them because, well, privacy. Meanwhile, websites throw up pop-ups and overlays that no one reads, or ban entire continents, not because their users care but because a regulator said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Civics Lesson</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, one needs to learn what history says it means to be an American. Next, one needs to decide what they believe it means to be an American. How consistent are your beliefs with history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Next, one needs to determine what each political party claims it stands for and challenge the assumptions for how those claims are consistent with being an American and for progress. 
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, the questions of whether progress is needed, desired, and how it looks needs to be decided, ultimately by each individual. 
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the Republican’s point of view, the credibility of the Supreme Court and the sanctity of the Constitution is not what is at stake. What is at stake is putting in permanent place Supreme Court justices that support only their ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple problem we have is that nobody in positions of Power in this country, be they elected officials, corporations, or oligarchs, are factoring consequences in to their decisions. The only consequence they do fear is not getting their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point you might have been able to say they these people are simply doing what they thinks is best for the United States and that there can be different approaches toward the same ends. I no longer believe this to be true, the ultimate motivation is staying in power and satisfying the people responsible for that power.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;How much do the Trump rallys cost the U.S. taxpayer? We are definitely paying for the secret service and police protection, what about the transportation and all other accommodations? You can say the same thing about every weekend trip to his golf courses and resorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company’s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it occurs to me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html&quot;&gt;my analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Cub’s performance in last year’s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer’s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Overtime Baseball</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the Cub’s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana’s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub’s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer’s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer’s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don’t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/29/004408.html&quot;&gt;how we fix societal issues&lt;/a&gt;. The society we live in so large with so many people needing to change, it just doesn’t seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example the Civil Rights movement. I bet some thought that surely we had that race thing behind us. Sure, there will always be bigots, but it’s not so entrenched in the fabric of society any more, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have learned in the last two years is no, society really hasn’t changed much since the 60s, white people just pat themselves for the appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>They Liked His Anger</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Republicans complaining about partisanship I simply ask what is possibility more partisan than not even having a hearing on a SCOTUS nominee simply because the president is a Democrat? You have no integrity to make any such complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
