        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com/news/story/dGEppTolfNwnPUMuqcH-LTkRL1NBM?ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Two people shot on the Central Michigan Campus&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time I write this the man hunt for the shooter is in progress. Immediately on Twitter are the gun control/anti-control fanatics tweeting away. What is always lost is context. The problem isn’t necessarily this one event, the problem is that this event is just the lastest instance of something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, all we have are advocates of each side of the solution yelling at each other so that &lt;strong&gt;nothing is being done.&lt;/strong&gt; So, from where I stand the real issue at this moment is the fact that we doing nothing but just live with the problem, which is a sign for how low our society has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In her article titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://points.datasociety.net/alternative-facts-alternative-truths-ab9d446b06c&quot;&gt;Alternative Facts, Alternative Truths&lt;/a&gt;” I think Dr. Francesca Tripodi provides a good example of the consequence of dualism as taught by fundamentalist churches. Issues like gun control, racism, and patriarchy do involve emotion as well as fact. In my opinion, just about all big decisions involve emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the matter of the Evangelical church’s view of Trump, what I think this article shows is missing is context. If all you look for are the words you like, and don’t stop to consider that the person providing them knows that and is intentionally saying them with no history to back them up, there is going to be a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There Is No Such Thing As Health Insurance</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/twenty-states-sue-federal-government-seeking-end-to-obamacare-idUSKCN1GB06R&quot;&gt;Twenty states have filed suit&lt;/a&gt; against the federal government basically because there is no business model in healthcare insurance. Before we can fix problems we have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree on what is the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree that the problem needs to be fixed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that the solution to every problem (healthcare) is not a hammer called capitalism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree on fundamental principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the business model for insurance is based on the premise that a company pays out less money than it takes in through people buying insurance. Property insurance works because it is possible that people who pay for it never need to file a claim through their life time. Likewise auto insurance works because there are people who never have to file a claim over a lifetime of driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In context, there really is no such thing as health insurance because every health care transaction is paid by the “health insurance” companies and just about everyone has one or more healthcare transactions per year. In other words, how does a “health insurance” company make money? If auto insurance was like healthcare, ever time one took their car in for an oil change or a tire rotation they would file an auto insurance claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we have to stop thinking that there is a capitalistic solution to the cost of health care. Just about all other countries around the world came to this realization and did something about it. We in the United States have drunk the capitalistic koolaid so much that we have forgotten our own history and just run around trying to hammer away every single problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stroh’s comeback has been interesting and I am wondering how successful they will be with a larger scale production of a session IPA. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am traveling to Bermuda tomorrow, and it will be the first trip on which I will carry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knomobags.com/usa/james-tote-backpack-deep-army-green.html?nosto=nosto-page-search1&quot;&gt;the James backpack&lt;/a&gt; from Knomo. I couldn’t resist the sale price, although I realize it is on sale because Knomo is closing out the product. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the subscription model may be good for individual developers, I think it will hurt the iOS app ecosystem. I can’t afford yearly subscriptions for all the apps I have on my iPad, so I will be forced to decrease down to a smaller number. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Carnival In Da Moonlight</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mtu.edu/carnival/&quot;&gt;Michigan Tech’s annual Winter Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is in progress, with the snow statue competition completing this morning. I attended Tech from 1984-89 and have good Carny memories. The number of hours students put in to building these statues is incredible and the results are fantastic. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigantech/collections/72157662834921158/&quot;&gt;the photos&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s really behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/08.html&quot;&gt;the massive, forceful, push to HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;? It doesn’t make sense to me that it must be used for every site. To achieve their apparent ends, HTTPS needs to be as easy and as expensive to implement as HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a smart light bulb or plug that does not automatically turn on after a power failure? It’s frustrating me that I cannot find one that allows me to configure what I want the default state to be. Plugs seem to default to last known state while light bulbs seem to default to on. &lt;/p&gt;

I still think it needs to be pushed more as a competitor to the Microsoft Surface rather than the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my Peel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://buypeel.com/products/super-thin-pixel-2-case&quot;&gt;Super Thin Pixel 2 case&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed very small and very light. So small and light that I now realize frequent removal may be problematic without breaking the case. OTOH, it enables one to retain the Pixel 2’s small size where the other Google cases I have been using do add bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was looking for an iOS app that could access and download files form an Amazon S3 bucket. The only real one I could find was Transmit, which cost $10 and is being removed from the store. I search more, but finding no others, I paid the $10 and bought it even though it likely will not be maintained. It did the job and probably will do so for a while until Amazon changes their API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/ipad-diaries/ipad-diaries-transmit-replacements-and-ftp-clients/&quot;&gt;this article on Macstories about alternatives to Transmit&lt;/a&gt; and in particular iFiles, which is cheaper and may do the job just as well. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The true effect of “trickle-down economics,” he writes, “is the way that the ideal of maximizing profit, not shared prosperity, has metastasized from financial markets and so shapes our entire society….”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, all of a sudden, people are waking up to the idea that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slashgear.com/universal-stylus-initiative-its-about-time-for-a-pen-comeback-01517697/&quot;&gt;stylus is not a bad thing&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to tablets. Again, there is a difference between a stylus being an accessory that enables more features and one that is required to operate a device. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think all app developers ought to be thinking of cross-platform data access. If I can’t get to my data from the web and any device I may use, I am likely not going to use your app. Hence apps like DevonThink are a show stopper for for me. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Feedback On The OmniFocus Roadmap</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018&quot;&gt;Omni’s roadmap for 2018&lt;/a&gt;. 
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn’t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the “minimalist” plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn’t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The stirring of leaves in the wind makes the wind visible. Their stirring is the wind’s stirring, their whisper is the wind’s whisper. And so with love. Our actions of love make the invisible visible. Our actions of love make love present to ourselves and to others. And as we go out of ourselves in love, and become, as it were, lost in those we love, we discover a self-greater than our isolated ego. We discover the birth of that self born of the death to self-centeredness.” from “Merton’s Palace of Nowhere” by James Finley, Henri J. M. Nouwen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I binged season 2 on Netflix last night, after being surprised to find it as I didn’t know it was made. I read the Shannara books a long time ago and I have fun trying to remember parts of the book while watching, although I know the TV Series is not an exact depiction. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capitalism &lt;&gt; Democracy</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eand.co/the-american-dream-is-over-this-is-the-age-of-the-european-dream-71c668bef945&quot;&gt;The American Dream is Over. This is the Age of the European Dream.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might not agree with the entire premise of the above article, but I think there is something to the point being made that we wrongly think markets/capitalism is the solution to every problem in our country. In fact, one can make the argument that capitalism is the root of much that is wrong in our country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the reality is capitalism (read revenue and profits) is the true reason why the NRA agressively opposes any gun control; the NRA’s corporate supporters make a lot of money off the sale of guns and ammunition and logically do not want any of that money to be at risk. Just like capitalism drove the tobacco industry to ignore studies showing smoking causes cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have been saying that we tend to confuse capitalism with democracy. I think this is reflected most prominently by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/&quot;&gt;Citizens United&lt;/a&gt; SCOTUS ruling that says corporate spending on politics is a form of free speech, and thus corporations have a right to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations are a construct of capitalism, they are not in themselves men or women of any race. In otherwords, corporations are not citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens United may be the worst SCOTUS ruling of my lifetime. Worse, it is reflects a flawed understanding that frankly skews society in favor of corporations and the oligarchs that profit from them. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Michigan State University President &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-michigan-state-lou-anna-simon-larry-nassar-20180124-story.html&quot;&gt;Lou Anna Simon’s resignation letter&lt;/a&gt; says a lot for why Larry Nassar was enabled by the university. The following statement says to me, “I am not to blame, but since I am the President I am the scapegoat.” MSU Alumni, parents, and students ought to be appalled by what appears to be institutionalized problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there an advantage to &lt;a href=&quot;https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/screencasts/&quot;&gt;writing something in Draft&lt;/a&gt;s and then pushing it over to micro.blog? One reason is that it is faster to paste a hyperlink into a post in Drafts than in the micro.blog iOS app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafts and Workflow are the two iOS apps that I really want to learn more about this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite articles to the contrary, Android Wear keeps ticking along. The latest evidence is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/tag-heuer-connected-modular-41-smartwatch-news/&quot;&gt;Tag Heuer’s newest watch&lt;/a&gt;. I believe more so than smartphones, Android Wear is really in the background such that it is more about companies like Tag Heuer and Fossil versus the Apple iWatch. &lt;/p&gt;
