        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chrome OS’ forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-apps-chrome-os-overview-crostini/&quot;&gt;ability to run Linux apps&lt;/a&gt; appears to me to mostly be something Google did so that their engineers could actually use the Pixelbook. Once that feature is seen in the code you might as well let the broad developer community in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited. Right now I can only think one app I will want to run in such a container and that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardnotes.org&quot;&gt;Standard Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A credit card company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17071478/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android&quot;&gt;robot keeps calling my smart phone&lt;/a&gt; and neither Google nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nomorobo&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; is able to catch it because each call is from a different number and often local. Right now, if caller ID doesn’t show something I recognize, I don’t answer the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think we need to outlaw phone calling robots, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335710/google-duplex-phone-call-ai-assistant-service-industry&quot;&gt;Google Duplex&lt;/a&gt; gets entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do we want our devices to become nannies? I get why Google and Microsoft are reacting to reports on the addictive nature of the devices, but it seems to me we need to learn self control and not rely on external influence to tell us what and what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drafts or Ulysses?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org&quot;&gt;one site&lt;/a&gt; that only has a “basic” web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it doesn’t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used some credit card reward to discount the cost of the Pad &amp;amp; Quill case for th iPad Pro 10.5 that &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/05/03/does-anyone-have.html&quot;&gt;I wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt;. The case arrived today and it is beautiful and provides plenty of protection but also adds bulk. It is going to take time for the leather to break in, so the race is between the breakin of the leather or me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching the Cubs play the Cardinals. So far two calls have been overturned by replay. Replay is showing how bad baseball umpires are, you can almost say something like 25% of all calls made in MLB history before replay were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a recommendation on a case for the iPad Pro 10.5? I prefer a case that doesn’t add bulk, is easy to take on/off, and has a place for the Apple Pencil. I like the look of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.padandquill.com/cases-for-ipad/oxford-leather-ipad-pro-105-case.html&quot;&gt;the Pad &amp;amp; Quill Oxford case&lt;/a&gt;, but I am uncertain about the adhesive tape and how easy it is to take the case off.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Blogging versus Social Networks</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You might think it too fine a point, but I think any blogging product requires the ability to edit what one has written. To me, editing is a fundamental difference between blogging and social networks because blogging is about permanence where as the social network timeline/newsfeed is a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, what makes micro blogging different from social networks like Twitter is the permance I describe above, and therefore editing should be a fundamental requirement for all micro blogging apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google releases a new Tasks app. It is a pretty barebones list making app that at least supports sub tasks. Unfortunately the iOS version is only for the iPhone and looks awful on the iPad, even the iPad Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gmail versus Inbox</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google has released the new version of Gmail, which I am checking out. I have been using, and like, Inbox mostly because how quickly I can use it to triage email. By triage I mean browse for messages I want to read and then quickly archiving all the remaining messages. No other app, including Gmail provides as easy a way to archive a group of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of Inbox is that it is very JavaScript heavy and therefore the web app performance can suffer. Another downside is that the app versions don’t look as good on larger screens such as on my 10.5 iPad Pro in landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am considering using Gmail on large screens and Inbox on small screens. However to decide that, I need to use the new Gmail for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Did a little more investigation into &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html&quot;&gt;the watch face that Fossil “pushed” to my smart watch last weekend&lt;/a&gt;. What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you “unlocked” a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each “new face” as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use a simple process for telling whether my computer is working too hard, I listen for the fan. By this simple measure I determined that Chrome was just killing my computer and checking Process Explorer I did see high CPU utilization. I switched to Firefox as my primary browser and so far the fan has been quiet and the browser more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

There has just been a major release and the latest version of the Docker image is not working for me. I take snapshots of the server as a back up, so I was able to revert back to the prior version of the server pretty easily. The process does involve creating a new instance from a snapshot, moving the public IP address to the new instance, and then deleting the old instance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;when corporations own all mass media, how can we trust the news?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything restored on the Pixel 2 except for the Android Wear settings, so now I have to factory reset my watches and completely reconfigure them to manage them in the Wear OS  app. What an awful user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something really bad just happened to my Pixel 2 to shut down and then not boot. I have had to do a factory reset. Now restoring from backup. I had just downloaded the NASA picture of the day and was making it the wallpaper on the phone when this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The right way for me — as well as the vast majority of the people I have coached over my years as an Evernote consultant — is by using notebooks and stacks as the primary organizing blocks of Evernote, with tags being used not as an organizational tool, but a find feature in Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used Evernote for a long time, and I use notebooks and stacks as the primary organizational method and tags to help find information. When seek information in Evernote I usually search for that information across all notes unless I expect to only find it in a certain notebook or stack.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com&quot;&gt;Drafts 5&lt;/a&gt;, purchased the yearly subscription, and I am now writing my first micro.blog post using it. Let’s see how well this works. Sent over to the micro.blog app where I can edit further. Of course, this method requires that you have the micro.blog app installed on your iPad, but you don’t have to generate a new app code for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After one day of full time usage, I am finding Firefox to be significantly faster than Chrome. One exception does seem to be with Inbox, which is heavy Javascript. I also may not have all of the Extensions installed in Firefox as I have in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boycotts and Free Speech </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don’t see how in any way that infringes on a person’s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person’s ability to make money on cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being “fair and balanced” is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder, back in the day, how many articles were written to explain Facebook and Twitter to people and convince them to use it? I am thinking that if someone has to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/540623/quit-facebook-twitter/&quot;&gt;an article to explain a social network&lt;/a&gt;, it’s too complicated and will not draw lots of people.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Assistant is still flawed by not enabling users to specify unique trigger words for each device. So, I use my smartphone as an alarm clock and I thought it would be cool to enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-routines/&quot;&gt;the Bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; that turns down the phone, sets an alarm and shuts off lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is that routine is enabled for Home and my Pixel phone. So, if I initiate the routine with the two in the same room, Home takes over and then sets the alarm for itself rather than on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think Google needs to do two things. First, it should provide a way to associate specific routines to specific assistant-enabled devices. Second, it needs to provide a way for users to create trigger words that are specific to devices. Right now, I can squeeze to trigger assistant on my phone and then start the routine, but that requires me to remember this rather than assistant being smart enough to remember for me.&lt;/p&gt;
