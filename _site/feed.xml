        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fox Theatre at night. I really like how this picture turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;No joy in Wrigleyville; the mighty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2018/08/21/detroit-tigers-chicago-cubs-score/1058989002/&quot;&gt;Cubs could not score more than one run last night&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to see more runs by the Cubs tonight. I say put the no guy in the line up.&lt;/p&gt;

It is an interesting signing of a player who seems to hurt the Cubs whenever he plays them. A bit surprising as a depth sign at Second considering they have Zobrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am heading down to Comerica Park to watch the Cubs and Tigers play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Icro is a micro.blog app for iOS, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hartlco/Icro&quot;&gt;it is now open source&lt;/a&gt;. I like the full screen display of Icro and the fact that when I return to the app it displays were I last left off in my timeline. However, I like how the micro.blog app for iOS displays conversations. I wish the micro.blog app had a full display rather than its current split between timeline and options.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google is releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/google-fit-gets-a-redesign-adds-heart-points-and-coaching/&quot;&gt;a new version of Google Fit&lt;/a&gt;. I use Google Fit to track my walking. My issues with it are less to do with the apps and more to do with the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not obvious how to download your fitness data and Google doesn’t really provide much in the way of analyzing data. When looking at data like this you want to see trends so you can answer questions like, did I walk more than last week? Did I walk more than last month? Last year? Improvement is measured over time not in a point of time. It is shocking to me that a company that bills itself as data driven is does not provide much, if anything, for analyzing this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the above article from Bloomberg fascinating, particularly that enough land is used to produce beer and Christmas trees to show up on the overall graphic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I faithfully use Google Calendar and Contacts, I seem to switch tasks apps after a few months. A few months ago I started using a new app and I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/ipad/2018/08/18/managing-tasks-with-noteplan.html&quot;&gt;an article about why I like Noteplan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Dream Cruise weekend in Detroit and it is always fun to see classic cars. Today I felt out of place witb out Terrain at the gas station.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there is a problem with viewing the Internet as publicly owned. The Internet is corporate owned and has been for some time and corporations who own it are going to make decisions that are in their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No part of the Internet is publicly owned, the last vestiges of that were given up when the FCC killed net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we truly want a free and open Internet we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets&quot;&gt;build a new one&lt;/a&gt; that is not controlled by corporations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html&quot;&gt;You can talk all you want about how you want companies to act&lt;/a&gt;, but they will not act in the public’s best interests unless it just happens to coincided with their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are companies like Apple that give the impression they do make decisions in the public’s best interests, but I think Apple’s stances on privacy are self serving, it is their competitive differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can say much the same thing about the corporate owned media in the United States. The press that existed at the time the first amendment was written is different than how how it exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little to no concept of “public square” today because nearly motive is driven by profit and no where enough motive is driven by public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you say, expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/eisenhower-warns-of-military-industrial-complex&quot;&gt;military industrial complex&lt;/a&gt;? We can’t afford to provide health care to the citizens of this country because all our tax dollars are used to make suppliers to the military wealthy. When is the last time you heard of cuts to the defense budget?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I enjoyed when I was in college, studying computer science, were lectures on things like this that were way over my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really want to know is, is this a new way to determine &lt;a href=&quot;https://oracleofbacon.org/&quot;&gt;six degrees of Kevin Bacon&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I do not like about Android Pie is that it is not obvious how to uninstall apps. When you tap and hold an app icon in the drawer the uninstall option does not display until you move the icon towards the top.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/amp/story/2018/08/14/americas-newspapers-just-played-right-into-trumps-hands-219360?utm_source=API+Need+to+Know+newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=298c4fe52c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_15_12_12&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e3bf78af04-298c4fe52c-34806089&amp;amp;__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;The plan&lt;/a&gt; by several newspapers across the country to all write editorials on the same day intended to rebut Trump’s claim that the press is the enemy of the people is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the press needs to just do its job. One thing that I do think might be helpful is to point out that every president has issues with the press, they likely can produce past video of democrat and republican presidents taking issue with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the thing, in this context, &lt;strong&gt;the President of the United States is not “the people.”&lt;/strong&gt; Consequently, a press that does NOT explicitly agree with the President is NOT an enemy of the people, if anything they may be an enemy of the President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump promotes the idea that he is just “one of us.” He, like all Presidents before him, is not just one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President serves us, and the Congress, the Supreme Court and yes, the Press, are the institutions identified by the founders of our country as being responsible to make sure the President serves faithfully by upholding his oath. By definition this means that when a person takes the oath of President of the United States, that person ceases being just one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

The worst thing that has happened  in the last 30 years is the general belief that it is wrong to change one’s mind, particularly if one is viewed as a leader. A real leader knows they always can learn, and therefore can always be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is important for you to know what you believe, but it is more important for you to ask yourself regularly, “Why do I believe what I believe?”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a long time user of Evernote, my first note was created in March 2008, but I have experience with that the original Windows app &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90216018/inside-evernotes-brain&quot;&gt;described in this article&lt;/a&gt;. My main attraction to Evernote has been how its purpose aligns to how I view personal computing.&lt;/p&gt;
