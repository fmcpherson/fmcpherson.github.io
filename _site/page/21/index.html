         	<p>While you can configure the Gmail app to use the same categories as Inbox, Gmail does not have a simple way to archive all messages in a category. For example, I want to see all Updates, scan through the list, and quickly archive them after I’ve read what I want to read. Gmail also does not have a button to snooze a message, but at least you can configure one of the two swipe actions to snooze.</p>

<p>Ack! Just realize that when I implemented categories (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums) in the Gmail app on my phone, that changes the web version of Gmail too. Worse, there is no single button way to archive all email of a category. You first have to select all messages and then buttons appear to mark read, archive, delete, etc..</p>

<p>So, Google, give me an easy way to archive all email in a category in Gmail and I will be unaffected by the demise of Inbox. Think about how fast it is to triage email in Inbox and enable that same capability in Gmail.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>

<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web’s permanence, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>

<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>

<p>To Dave’s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>

<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human beings were so charmed by the illusion of control Newton’s metaphor offered that we began to see ourselves as machines too. Believing that Newton told us the truth about how the world works, we modeled our institutions on atomistic principles.
…
Our “God view” came to resemble our worldview. In this century, even much of our practical theology has also become mechanical and atomistic. Walk into many churches and you will hear God described as a being who behaves almost as predictably as Newton’s universe. Say you believe in God and you will be saved.  Sin against God and you will be condemned. Say you are sorry and you will be forgiven.  Obey the law and you will be blessed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, the above is the closest I’ve seen written to what I think is the root problem within the Roman Catholic church. It is too simplistic to state the problem is gay priests or celibacy or not ordaining women, all those are simply symptoms to the problem, a problem more closely related to why the Roman Catholic church exists as an institution.</p>

         	<p>Forgotten in how the women’s final of the U.S. Open ended is that the problems started with one of the most asinine rules of professional sports. Just stop having tennis chair umpires policing “coaching” from the stands. No gesture made by a coach is going to make a difference, the players still have to execute. Further, the rule is not in any way consistently applied.</p>

<p>Tennis is not “special” because players are on their own, and fans pay good money to watch the players decide that match, not umpires.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://politicalwire.com/2018/09/07/we-are-a-superpower-run-by-a-simpleton/">Incompetency</a> is the primary reason why I could not and did not vote for Trump.  Current politics makes the problem worse. Not enough people took competency seriously enough and we are starting to pay the price.</p>

<p>The problem is that too many people confuse politics with competency, by which I mean they don’t think Trump is incompetent they just think Democrats and Republicans are simply preventing him from doing the job.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Founding Fathers were not unaware of the possibility that a demagogue or a knave might win the presidency. That’s why they checked the executive with an independent Congress and built in powers of impeachment. That Republicans in this Congress have proven so subservient to — or scared of — Trump that they have let the fate of the country hinge on whether his staff can adequately distract and calm him is a subversion of the constitutional order and an abdication of responsibility.</p>
