  Next, one needs to determine what each political party claims it stands for and challenge the assumptions for how those claims are consistent with being an American and for progress.

         	<p>From the Republican’s point of view, the credibility of the Supreme Court and the sanctity of the Constitution is not what is at stake. What is at stake is putting in permanent place Supreme Court justices that support only their ideology.</p>

<p>The simple problem we have is that nobody in positions of Power in this country, be they elected officials, corporations, or oligarchs, are factoring consequences in to their decisions. The only consequence they do fear is not getting their way.</p>

<p>At one point you might have been able to say they these people are simply doing what they thinks is best for the United States and that there can be different approaches toward the same ends. I no longer believe this to be true, the ultimate motivation is staying in power and satisfying the people responsible for that power.</p>

  <p>When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company’s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.</p>

         	<p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub’s performance in last year’s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>

<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer’s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>

<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>

<p>For me the Cub’s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana’s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub’s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer’s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer’s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>

<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don’t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

         	<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>

<p>Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.</p>

<p>“Trump had his theme of national nativism, and he’s pushing that, so I think the opposite of that is a more inclusive — a more generous — sense of what it is to be an American,” he said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We base everything from our private morality to our public policies and every major value in between on this nebulous thing called “rights.”…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there are some issues with basing everything on rights. For one, they’ve tended to be negatively defined. “I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.”…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This negative definition of rights is what inspired an entire book by the great 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer reflecting on the culture shock of his time spent teaching in New York. He was puzzled that we Americans seem to talk a lot about what we are “free from,” but hardly anyone ever brings up what we might be “free for.” Yes, there are all these things which we don’t want to infringe upon our lives. But what are we living for? What positive thing should we be seeking to enrich and improve our lives?</p>
