<p>Would there even be a debate about whether an iPad can be one’s only computer if touchscreens were invented before the mouse? IMHO the major impediment is iOS’ lack of support for Bluetooth mice.</p>

<p>I think if Apple wanted to, they could take a cue from Google’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/">Project Crostini</a> to add containerized desktop app support to iOS. The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>

<p>I’ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished. Containers come close to this idea.</p>

         	<p>I am not feeling euphoric by seeing Democrats win the House. I am heartend by the number of women who ran and won, but this is just the first step. Before <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/democrats-trump-investigations/">the Dems go crazy with investigations</a>, they should consider why Trump won in the first place. We need progress on real issues more than we need revenge.</p>

<p>If the Democrats in the House fall into the trap of Washington nazel gazing this small victory could lead to a Trump re-election in 2020. Yes, provide oversight, but more importantly listen to <strong>all</strong> of your constituents and try to do something to help them!</p>

         	<p>The pricing and models for the Lenovo Yoga C630 are confusing.

If you want a C630 with a backlit keyboard you can only buy one from Lenovo’s web site.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-midnight-blue/6295998.p?skuId=6295998">Best Buy has a version of the C630</a> with an I5 128 GB of storage and no backlit keyboard for $649. Best Buy also has <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-hp-finish-in-ceramic-white-and-cloud-blue/6301869.p?skuId=6301869">the HP X360 X14 for $549</a>.</p>

<p>The low end Lenovo C630 that you can buy from their web site appears to compete head on with the HP X360 X14.</p>

         	<p>I’ve been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.</p>

<p>Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage.</p>

<p>Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.</p>

         	<p>I am trying out <a href="https://www.trunknotes.com/">TrunkNotes</a>, which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to <a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">VoodooPad</a>. <del>One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.</del></p>

<p>Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.</p>
