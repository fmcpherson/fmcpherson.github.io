<p>If we think deeply about the consequences of debt you see meaning. Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free.</p>

<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word “sin” with “debt” more often.</p>

<p>Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it.</p>

<p>Probably because they don’t think there is a serious risk of going to jail. The country, and what most will accept is much different now than during Watergate. I doubt we will ever see a Republican tell Trump he should resign as he is sure to be impeached.</p>
