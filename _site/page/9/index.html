The only real one I could find was Transmit, which cost $10 and is being removed from the store. I search more, but finding no others, I paid the $10 and bought it even though it likely will not be maintained. It did the job and probably will do so for a while until Amazon changes their API.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not see <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ipad-diaries/ipad-diaries-transmit-replacements-and-ftp-clients/">this article on Macstories about alternatives to Transmit</a> and in particular iFiles, which is cheaper and may do the job just as well.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/01/30/feedback-on-the.html">Feedback On The OmniFocus Roadmap</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018">Omni’s roadmap for 2018</a>. 
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn’t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do.</p>

<p>My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the “minimalist” plan.</p>

<p>A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.</p>

<p>I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn’t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use.</p>

<p>I’ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The stirring of leaves in the wind makes the wind visible. Their stirring is the wind’s stirring, their whisper is the wind’s whisper. And so with love. Our actions of love make the invisible visible. Our actions of love make love present to ourselves and to others. And as we go out of ourselves in love, and become, as it were, lost in those we love, we discover a self-greater than our isolated ego. We discover the birth of that self born of the death to self-centeredness.” from “Merton’s Palace of Nowhere” by James Finley, Henri J. M. Nouwen</p>
