		<h1><a href="/2018/01/02/the-storyline-for.html">The Storyline For Today's GLi Championship</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Later today Michigan Tech will play Bowling Green in the championship game of the 53rd Great Lakes Invitational hockey tournament. It is the first GLi at the new Little Caesars’s Arena and is hosted by Michigan Tech.</p>

<p>Either of the potential opponents for Tech in the championship presented interesting story lines. Had Michigan won Tech would be facing their former coach, Mel Pearson, who just left his Alma mater to become Michigan’s head coach. Tech’s return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm.</p>

<p>Pearson’s last game as Tech’s head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which <a href="http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php">the Huskies beat Bowling Green</a> to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid. What better way for the Falcons to gain revenge for that loss than by beating Tech in their tournament in the new arena and carry home the MacInnes Cup, named for legendary Tech coach <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacInnes">John MacInnes</a>?</p>
