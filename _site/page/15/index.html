         	<p>Looking at <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/user/120423">my Geekbench profile</a> that shows the performance of my computers, I think you get an understanding of why Meltdown exists.</p>

<p>What you see is computers with nearly the same clock speed and number of cores but widely different performance. I think it shows that while the physical performance (clock speed) is nearly the same, newer chips perform better due to all the parallel processing occuring within the chip.</p>

<p>I think there is something to the point made in the article about the impact of moving from pensions to 401ks. For one thing, it reinforced the idea that the stock market is the only measure of success, without asking success for whom.</p>

         	<p>Later today Michigan Tech will play Bowling Green in the championship game of the 53rd Great Lakes Invitational hockey tournament. It is the first GLi at the new Little Caesars’s Arena and is hosted by Michigan Tech.</p>

<p>Either of the potential opponents for Tech in the championship presented interesting story lines. Had Michigan won Tech would be facing their former coach, Mel Pearson, who just left his Alma mater to become Michigan’s head coach. Tech’s return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm.</p>

<p>Pearson’s last game as Tech’s head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which <a href="http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php">the Huskies beat Bowling Green</a> to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid. What better way for the Falcons to gain revenge for that loss than by beating Tech in their tournament in the new arena and carry home the MacInnes Cup, named for legendary Tech coach <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacInnes">John MacInnes</a>?</p>
