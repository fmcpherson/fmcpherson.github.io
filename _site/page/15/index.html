<p>I’ve been running Android P on my Pixel 2 for a couple of weeks and I have not had any problems with it. I also think it is an iterative improvement on Oreo, meaning that if you don’t have It you aren’t necessarily missing out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/24/every-new-android-p-feature-weve-found-far-continuously-updated/">Android Police has a complete rundown</a> of all the new things. Oddly, my favorite may be the charging sound, as I have had cases when I thought I was charging my phone when I wasn’t because the charger was completely plugged in.  The cleaned up settings and notifications are nice, and the navigation improvements are ok but not amazing. I am still looking for significant improvement in battery life.</p>

         	<p>I am pretty much following <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>, hosting my content with domains I own on either <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">micro.blog</a> or <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">Netlify</a>, and syndicating that content to <a href="https://twitter.com/frankm">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://fjmnotes.com">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>One problem with this approach is that syndication only occurs once. If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.</p>

<p>One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.</p>

<p>I bought the Surface 3 because of its support for an active digitizer. Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad.</p>

<p>Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don’t really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.</p>

We much rather just have someone take care of us. True originalists understand that the founders did not build a Presidency, they built a Congress.</p>

<p>The problem is that for the last 100 years Congress has been about building a Presidency.</p>

<p>Google has released the final public beta for Android P, so I have decided to install it on my Pixel 2. I’ve enabled the gesture navigation and so far everything works great and the phone seems faster.</p>

The majority of my personal computing is done on a tablet, either an iPad Mini or an iPad Pro. I use my smartphone when when I don’t have my tablet or in location where using a tablet is not practical.</p>

<p>If I didn’t own the iPad Pro 10.5 I would probably be all over the Surface Pro Go.</p>

         	<p>Trumps tax cuts <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-18/trump-s-tax-cut-hasn-t-done-anything-for-workers">are not cutting it</a>. The idea of cutting taxes will result in more jobs and higher wages is a myth. Corporations are hyper-optimized for shareholder return, which is done by cutting jobs and maintaining or lowering wages.</p>

<p>In almost all areas in the United States, mistakes are being made on the fundamentals. If the premise upon which a decision is based is wrong, then the decision and its consequences are wrong.</p>

<p>The foundation is cracking, and nobody is willing to face up to this reality.</p>
