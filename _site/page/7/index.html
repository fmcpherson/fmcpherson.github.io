         	<p>Google is releasing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/google-fit-gets-a-redesign-adds-heart-points-and-coaching/">a new version of Google Fit</a>. I use Google Fit to track my walking. My issues with it are less to do with the apps and more to do with the data.</p>

<p>It is not obvious how to download your fitness data and Google doesn’t really provide much in the way of analyzing data. When looking at data like this you want to see trends so you can answer questions like, did I walk more than last week? Did I walk more than last month? Last year? Improvement is measured over time not in a point of time. It is shocking to me that a company that bills itself as data driven is does not provide much, if anything, for analyzing this data.</p>

         	<p>In my opinion, there is a problem with viewing the Internet as publicly owned. The Internet is corporate owned and has been for some time and corporations who own it are going to make decisions that are in their best interests.</p>

<p>No part of the Internet is publicly owned, the last vestiges of that were given up when the FCC killed net neutrality.</p>

<p>If we truly want a free and open Internet we need to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets">build a new one</a> that is not controlled by corporations. <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html">You can talk all you want about how you want companies to act</a>, but they will not act in the public’s best interests unless it just happens to coincided with their own interests.</p>

<p>Yes, there are companies like Apple that give the impression they do make decisions in the public’s best interests, but I think Apple’s stances on privacy are self serving, it is their competitive differentiator.</p>

<p>You can say much the same thing about the corporate owned media in the United States. The press that existed at the time the first amendment was written is different than how how it exists today.</p>

<p>There is little to no concept of “public square” today because nearly motive is driven by profit and no where enough motive is driven by public good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the press needs to just do its job. One thing that I do think might be helpful is to point out that every president has issues with the press, they likely can produce past video of democrat and republican presidents taking issue with them.</p>

<p>And here is the thing, in this context, <strong>the President of the United States is not “the people.”</strong> Consequently, a press that does NOT explicitly agree with the President is NOT an enemy of the people, if anything they may be an enemy of the President.</p>

<p>Trump promotes the idea that he is just “one of us.” He, like all Presidents before him, is not just one of us.</p>

<p>The President serves us, and the Congress, the Supreme Court and yes, the Press, are the institutions identified by the founders of our country as being responsible to make sure the President serves faithfully by upholding his oath. By definition this means that when a person takes the oath of President of the United States, that person ceases being just one of us.</p>
