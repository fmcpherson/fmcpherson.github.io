All I need to do is create one slide, with a picture, and some text, and I find that impossible to do with PowerPoint on iOS. You type a character and wait, I did you not, ten seconds, for it to appear on the screen and the cursor to move. How can Microsoft, in 2017, produce such a horribly performing test? Do they not even test these things? </p>

  <p>Ask why they are willing to risk going to jail to protect the president.</p>

<p>Probably because they don’t think there is a serious risk of going to jail. The country, and what most will accept is much different now than during Watergate. I doubt we will ever see a Republican tell Trump he should resign as he is sure to be impeached. </p>

<p>Apparently, when something I ordered is delivered to the locker, I will get an email with a six digit code that I then use at the locker location to retrieve my package. I have three days to pick up the package otherwise it will be returned for refund. Perhaps best of all, lockers can be used as a drop off location for returns.</p>

<p>Given the rise in people having deliveries stolen, I can see these lockers becoming useful for valuable items being shipped for which you may not be hope to sign for.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/12/17/the-nfl-continues.html">The NFL Continues To Reward Violent Hits </a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Despite scientific research and Congressional hearings, the NFL is still not serious about the safety of its players due to concussions. In fact, the current NFL rules <strong>rewards</strong> teams of players who inflict a concussion.</p>

<p>The latest example occurred during the Packers and Panthers game on December 17. During the game Panther Thomas Davis launched into Davante Adams resulting in Adams being removed for the game due to the obvious helmet-on-helmet hit. A personal foul was called on Davis, but he remained in the game while the Packers lost one of their most important players. </p>

<p>Players who may be concussed must be removed from play until doctors confirm it is ok for him to return. In this case, the right thing happened while that has not always been the case. However, how is it that the player causing the injury, unnecessarily, is still allowed to play?</p>

<p>Treating concussions is important but equally important is preventing concussions from happening in the first place, and that will not happen without immediate and significant enforcement on the field. All direct hits to the head should result in an immediate ejection, and this rule should be enforced not only by on field officials but also by replay. At a minimum the NFL ought to have a booth review, as is the case with the NCAA, but I favor the booth being able to eject such players at any time. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that the current approach of only reviewing and penalizing such plays after the game is over is not sufficient in deterring such hits and violates the spirit of the game. The life time health of the players demands extreme action. If the NFL is unable to police itself then Congress must step in with regulation. Right now it appears profits are outweighing safety. </p>
