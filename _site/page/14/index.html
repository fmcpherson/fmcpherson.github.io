<blockquote>
  <p>It is beyond comprehension, the degree to which the Democratic party nationally has essentially abdicated half of the states in this country to rightwing Republicans, including some of the poorest states in America, those in the south,” Sanders said. “The reason I go to Kansas and many so-called red states is that I will do everything that I can to bring new people into the political process in states which are today conservative. I do not know how you turn those states around unless you go there and get people excited</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also can’t assume you have a state won. I believe the 2016 Presidential election would have a different outcome had Hilary actively campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Back in the day before Gmail I used to run my own email server in my house. It was a bit of a pain to maintain, but it satisfied the geek in me. There is a company that is selling <a href="https://thehelm.com/pages/product">an IoT-like email server</a> that costs $500. I’ve never heard of the company and therefore can’t vouch for it, but I find the appliance intriguing. Just found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/10/meet-helm-the-startup-taking-on-gmail-with-a-server-that-runs-in-your-home/">an article on Ars Technica</a> about this product.</p>

<p>The solution, called Helm, sounds a lot like <a href="https://twitter.com/pogoplug?lang=en">Pogoplug</a>, which was a personal cloud storage device that is no longer available. The risk of using a product from a small company that might not stay in business to store and access personal data is something one has to take in to consideration.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I looked for the oldest message in my Gmail archive, its from when I first got an account in May, 2004.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing that makes everybody exhausted is when people are speaking and acting out of a need to be right all the time. That need to be right is the thing that I most need to be saved from. When I’m okay with being wrong and letting others teach me something, I’m less exhausting to them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Television producers booked one right-wing religious figure after another, all taking the side of Terri Schiavo’s parents, as if “religion” spoke with one voice on this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, many assume that how they see Christianity represented by talking heads on TV defines Christianity. One of the biggest mistakes made about religion is thinking that there is one voice on Christian thought, which is why government decisions based on Christian ethics conflicts with the first amendment.</p>

<p>When I scroll down through the results, I am not so convinced, particularly when I read this definition of The Politically Disengaged, which made up 26 percent of the participants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Politically Disengaged (26 percent of the population) are untrusting, suspicious about external threats, conspiratorially minded, and pessimistic about progress. They tend to be patriotic yet detached from politics</p>
