         	<p>My Notes From The Apple Event</p>

<p>Tim Cook was max PT Barnum at the Apple Event, which I find annoying after listening for 20 minutes. At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>

<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>

<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>

         	<p>So, it <a href="https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/Houston-Astros-Boston-Red-Sox-ALCS-Game-5-recap-13318892.php">turns out</a> the 2018 Astros were not any better than the 2017 Cubs.</p>

<p>Nothing is static, particularly baseball. It is not likely your team will be exactly the same, someone is going to get injured. More importantly, the competition is not going to stay the same, they are going to get better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is beyond comprehension, the degree to which the Democratic party nationally has essentially abdicated half of the states in this country to rightwing Republicans, including some of the poorest states in America, those in the south,” Sanders said. “The reason I go to Kansas and many so-called red states is that I will do everything that I can to bring new people into the political process in states which are today conservative. I do not know how you turn those states around unless you go there and get people excited</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also can’t assume you have a state won. I believe the 2016 Presidential election would have a different outcome had Hilary actively campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>
