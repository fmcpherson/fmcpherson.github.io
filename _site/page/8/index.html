		<h1><a href="/2018/01/30/feedback-on-the.html">Feedback On The OmniFocus Roadmap</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018">Omni’s roadmap for 2018</a>. 
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn’t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do.</p>

<p>My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the “minimalist” plan.</p>

<p>A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.</p>

<p>I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn’t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use.</p>

<p>I’ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out.</p>

  <p>“The stirring of leaves in the wind makes the wind visible. Their stirring is the wind’s stirring, their whisper is the wind’s whisper. And so with love. Our actions of love make the invisible visible. Our actions of love make love present to ourselves and to others. And as we go out of ourselves in love, and become, as it were, lost in those we love, we discover a self-greater than our isolated ego. We discover the birth of that self born of the death to self-centeredness.” from “Merton’s Palace of Nowhere” by James Finley, Henri J. M. Nouwen</p>

<p>One might not agree with the entire premise of the above article, but I think there is something to the point being made that we wrongly think markets/capitalism is the solution to every problem in our country. In fact, one can make the argument that capitalism is the root of much that is wrong in our country.</p>

<p>For example, the reality is capitalism (read revenue and profits) is the true reason why the NRA agressively opposes any gun control; the NRA’s corporate supporters make a lot of money off the sale of guns and ammunition and logically do not want any of that money to be at risk. Just like capitalism drove the tobacco industry to ignore studies showing smoking causes cancer.</p>

<p>For a long time I have been saying that we tend to confuse capitalism with democracy. I think this is reflected most prominently by the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United</a> SCOTUS ruling that says corporate spending on politics is a form of free speech, and thus corporations have a right to free speech.</p>

<p>Corporations are a construct of capitalism, they are not in themselves men or women of any race. In otherwords, corporations are not citizens.</p>

<p>Citizens United may be the worst SCOTUS ruling of my lifetime. Worse, it is reflects a flawed understanding that frankly skews society in favor of corporations and the oligarchs that profit from them.</p>
