<p>Wear OS Update H installed on my watch two days ago. There appears to be a problem recovering from the new “deep sleep” / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this “feature?”</p>

<p>I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I’ve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.</p>

  <p>And as for the outdatedness, the current Fortran standard is Fortran 2008. The next one is 2018 and it is expected to arrive anytime soon. Fortran is constantly being modernized one little step after another. The biggest holding factor here is its mission. It must remain simple for real engineers.</p>

<p>When I started college in 1984 Fortran was the language taught in the introductory programming class required by computer science and engineering students. Advanced computer science classes used Pascal. Java did not exist then.</p>
