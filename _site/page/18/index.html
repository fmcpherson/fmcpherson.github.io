         	<p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub’s performance in last year’s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>

<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer’s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>

<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>

<p>For me the Cub’s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana’s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub’s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer’s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer’s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>

<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don’t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

<p>Take for example the Civil Rights movement. I bet some thought that surely we had that race thing behind us. Sure, there will always be bigots, but it’s not so entrenched in the fabric of society any more, is it?</p>

<p>What we have learned in the last two years is no, society really hasn’t changed much since the 60s, white people just pat themselves for the appearance.</p>

         	<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>

<p>Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.</p>

         	<p>The pervasive belief that girls and women just make stuff up about sexual assult is what enables it to happen in the first place.

It’s not about democracy or governing, it’s all about privilege and power and getting what one wants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We base everything from our private morality to our public policies and every major value in between on this nebulous thing called “rights.”…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there are some issues with basing everything on rights. For one, they’ve tended to be negatively defined. “I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.”…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This negative definition of rights is what inspired an entire book by the great 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer reflecting on the culture shock of his time spent teaching in New York. He was puzzled that we Americans seem to talk a lot about what we are “free from,” but hardly anyone ever brings up what we might be “free for.” Yes, there are all these things which we don’t want to infringe upon our lives. But what are we living for? What positive thing should we be seeking to enrich and improve our lives?</p>

<p>“It is no secret that culturally at this point in time, discourse has devolved to the most acute volley of “two wrongs make a right” that we may have ever historically seen. We have taken this pathological diversion to a whole other level, to the point where we are able to create impasses that are so acute, they have the appearance of being impossible to transform out of. And I wonder sometimes, when we sit in our disintegrated state, if we want to move from the impasse. The impasse itself has become like a nice comfy couch to curl up on”</p>

<p>It should be obvious that politicians do not want high voter turnout otherwise there would be a law or amendment to make election day a national holiday, or move it to a Saturday. The same applies to education in the United States. Changes have intentionally not been made because those in power benefit from the status quoe.</p>

<p>It was not my first smartphone, but I was a proud owner of the T-Mobile G1, the first Google phone. For me the G1 was more about the Google experience than the hardware. I’ve always felt that Google’s Internet first, information first approach aligned better to my needs than Apple’s end user experience first, hardware design first approach.</p>

Kavanaugh most likely will withdraw himself as candidate at the urging of the Republicans or Trump. They have plenty of alternatives who will enable their agenda equally well.</p>

<p>Or, they could go through the process to make it all look nice and approve him anyway.</p>

         	<p>I’ve installed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/">the new Shortcuts app</a> and so far see some good and some not so good.</p>

<p>Good: I created a Siri Shortcut that turns on Do Not Disturb until a time I specify and the launches the Kindle app.</p>

<p>Not so good: I’ve created a Siri Shortcut for a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/extensions/sharing-and-actions/">action extension</a> workflow I have that shares the current web page in Safari as a link formatted in markdown. What I want to do is open a page in Safari, evoke Siri and say “share this page” however once Siri starts Safari is not accessible so the web page and URL cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>Basically, I was hoping Siri Shortcuts would understand the context of what is on screen, but it cannot because once you launch Siri she has focus. As far as I can tell, you have to use the share extension to do what I am trying to do.</p>
