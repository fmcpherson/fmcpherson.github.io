         	<p>I’ve been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.</p>

<p>Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage.</p>

<p>Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.</p>

         	<p>I am trying out <a href="https://www.trunknotes.com/">TrunkNotes</a>, which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to <a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">VoodooPad</a>. <del>One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.</del></p>

<p>Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.</p>

<p>I am planning to by a new Chromebook this year, and I am working on an article that describes which ones I am considering and why. As I was writing that article to occurred to me a more fundamental question I needed to answer is why am I even considering Chrome OS? Consequently, I’ve written the above to be foundational to the next article.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://fionavoss.blog/2018/06/24/untitled-blog-posts/">Untitled blog posts were a game changer for my writing</a></p>

<p>I think blog posts are a form of writing that is under appreciated. First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.</p>

<p>I don’t write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one’s voice. You don’t have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.</p>

         	<p>My Notes From The Apple Event</p>

<p>Tim Cook was max PT Barnum at the Apple Event, which I find annoying after listening for 20 minutes. At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>

<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>

<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>
