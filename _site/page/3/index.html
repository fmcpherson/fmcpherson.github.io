			<h1><a href="/2018/06/30/long-form-writing.html">Long Form Writing and Trying Out Netlify</a></h1>
		

        <a href="/2018/06/30/long-form-writing.html" class="u-url"><span class="post-meta"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-06-30 11:38:04 -0400">Jun 30, 2018</time></span></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>

<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>

<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">Let’s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The “broad” push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href="http://1999.io">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don’t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>

<p>So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn’t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>

<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I’ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>

<p>I don’t listen to many podcasts any more now that I don’t spend an hour a day in the car commuting to an office.  In fact, most of my recent podcast listening has been using Apple’s Podcast app on an iPad.</p>

         	<p>I think I know what happened. With previous posts I published from Ulysses I did not enable markdown in the publishing dialog and therefore the publisher converted the markdown to HTML so it appeared correct in Wordpress. In the previous post I enabled markdown, and since Wordpress was not configured to use markdown it did not render properly. So, to have enabled markdown in the writing settings of the WP-Admin console, which fixed the problem.</p>

<p>In other words…. operator error! :)</p>

         	<p>Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don’t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.</p>

<p>The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.</p>

<p>Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don’t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.</p>
