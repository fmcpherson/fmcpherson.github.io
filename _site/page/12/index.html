<blockquote>
  <p>It is beyond comprehension, the degree to which the Democratic party nationally has essentially abdicated half of the states in this country to rightwing Republicans, including some of the poorest states in America, those in the south,” Sanders said. “The reason I go to Kansas and many so-called red states is that I will do everything that I can to bring new people into the political process in states which are today conservative. I do not know how you turn those states around unless you go there and get people excited</p>

<p>You also can’t assume you have a state won. I believe the 2016 Presidential election would have a different outcome had Hilary actively campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

         	<p>Back in the day before Gmail I used to run my own email server in my house. It was a bit of a pain to maintain, but it satisfied the geek in me. There is a company that is selling <a href="https://thehelm.com/pages/product">an IoT-like email server</a> that costs $500. I’ve never heard of the company and therefore can’t vouch for it, but I find the appliance intriguing. Just found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/10/meet-helm-the-startup-taking-on-gmail-with-a-server-that-runs-in-your-home/">an article on Ars Technica</a> about this product.</p>

<p>The solution, called Helm, sounds a lot like <a href="https://twitter.com/pogoplug?lang=en">Pogoplug</a>, which was a personal cloud storage device that is no longer available. The risk of using a product from a small company that might not stay in business to store and access personal data is something one has to take in to consideration.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I looked for the oldest message in my Gmail archive, its from when I first got an account in May, 2004.</p>

  <p>The thing that makes everybody exhausted is when people are speaking and acting out of a need to be right all the time. That need to be right is the thing that I most need to be saved from. When I’m okay with being wrong and letting others teach me something, I’m less exhausting to them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many assume that how they see Christianity represented by talking heads on TV defines Christianity. One of the biggest mistakes made about religion is thinking that there is one voice on Christian thought, which is why government decisions based on Christian ethics conflicts with the first amendment.</p>

         	<p>The gist of <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2801077-packers-put-aaron-rodgers-in-impossible-situation-and-he-keeps-delivering">the articles</a> currently being written about Aaron Rodgers and the Packers is that the Packers are wasting what time they have left with Aaron. Frankly, I had the same complaints about how the Packer’s treated the second half of Brett Farve’s career.</p>

<p>You have one of the best, if not the best, quarterbacks in the league, but you do not keep him surrounded by good talent. Good receivers, running backs, offensive line, or defense. You put in place a coach who frankly doesn’t appear to have a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>The Packers were very fortunate to have drafted Aaron and that he was better than they most likely thought when he was drafted. Most teams do not replace one hall of fame quarterback with another hall of fame quarterback. It is not likely they will do the same when it comes time for Aaron to step down, and that means that every season that Aaron plays in which you don’t win a Super Bowl could be another year added to many, many years of not winning one.</p>

         	<p>Are good speakers really an important component for a smartphone? Google’s commitment to dual front facing speakers is a head scratcher. I know it was HTC’s thing back in the day, but if I am listening to audo on my Pixel I am using a headset. If I want to fill a room with sound I will connect to an external speaker using Bluetooth or Chromecast.</p>

         	<p>How much screen time is too much screen time? Looking at the <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/digital-wellbeing-beta/">Digital Wellbeing Android app</a>, there were only two days last weekn when my Pixel 2 screen was on for more than an hour. Only three times last week I uinlocked my phone more than 20 times.</p>

<p>The main problem I see with Digital Wellbeing is that it doesn’t easily show history or averages. You open the app and see your current consumption, but that info is not useful when it is not related to anything. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">Screen Time setting in iOS</a> shows averages and how that relates to prior weeks.</p>

<p>Still, while the information in Screen Time is interesting, it says I pick up my iOS devices (two iPads) on average 42 times a day, I have no idea what that means? Is it good? bad?</p>

         	<p>We saw Elton John last night for the first and last time, as this is his farewell tour and I believe it to be true. The show was fantastic, particularly when you consider that Elton is 71 years old. He played for a little over two and a half hours, with no intermission. After each song he would stand up, acknowledge the crowd as he did a circle around the piano seat, take a drink of water, sit down and launch into another song.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen a musical act with so much percussion. Two full drum sets, three drummers, including tympani, bells, and tambourine. The dude playing the tambourine, which was well miced, got more video time than the guitars. The act, however, had no cowbell.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple notes on Little Caesar’s Arena. It was the first concert that we attended at LCA. In an email the day before we were told the arena would open at 6:30 PM and encouraged people to come early, Elton was starting promptly at 8 PM. The arena didn’t open until 7 PM, which was very annoying.</p>

<p>We had seats in the upper bowl, which frankly were the cheapest seats. The climb to the seats in the upper bowl is pretty steep, and I felt bad for some of thr elderly and disabled who made the climb.</p>

         	<p>Google classifies the Pixel Slate as <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate">a Tablet with Google Assistant</a>. Based on <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/11/my-definition-of.html">my definition of tablets</a>, the Slate is not a tablet, it is a 2-in-1. If you stick to Google’s view of it as a tablet then I stand by <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/09/first-reaction-to.html">my initial impression</a> that the Slate could be DOA.</p>

<p>My concerns about it are driven by the total cost of ownership. I start with the 8 GB, 64 GB, Intel Core M model that costs $799, and then add a keyboard, either the Google keyboard that costs $199 or the <a href="https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate">Brydge G-Type</a> that costs $159, making the minimum total cost $958; throw in the pen and that is just north of $1,000. For my money I much rather buy the Pixelbook or any one of the newer Chromebooks than pay $1000 for the Slate 2-in-1. Arguably <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5?icid=surfacedept_nav3_surfacefamily_100218&amp;activetab=pivot:techspecstab">the Surface Pro 6</a> is a better option, and it would definitely be better for me because I know I can use a pen with OneNote.</p>

<p>The Slate does look like a nice piece of hardware, and if you want Android and Linux apps on a 2-in-1 it’s your only viable option, but is that option more appealing than an iPad Pro? Particularly a newer, larger screen, same form factor, smaller bezel iPad Pro? I am skeptical.</p>
