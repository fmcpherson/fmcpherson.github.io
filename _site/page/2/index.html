<p>I am thinking if Chromebook manufacturers expect people to be using Linux apps, wouldn’t they provide storage options greater than 64 GB? I find the news about Linux support on Chromebooks intriguing enough for me to consider purchasing a new one once the feature is widely available.</p>

<p>In a democracy the leader does not dictate behavior, that is called dictatorship. The fact that Trump does not get the fundamentals of democracy is scary, and the fact that we elected such a person President is very disappointing. The fact that so many people do not see this as an issue is frightening, and a sign that our democracy may already be lost.</p>

Once that feature is seen in the code you might as well let the broad developer community in on the fun.</p>

<p>The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited. Right now I can only think one app I will want to run in such a container and that is <a href="https://standardnotes.org">Standard Notes</a>.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.</p>

<p>Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">one site</a> that only has a “basic” web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.</p>

<p>To me, it doesn’t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.</p>
