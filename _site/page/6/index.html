         	<p>I am seeing a <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-pixel-slate-images-keyboard-cover-specifications-nocturne/">fair amount of excitement</a> in anticipation of a possible Google tablet being announced tomorrow. The tablet will run the latest iteration of Chrome OS that runs Android and Linux apps.</p>

<p>Google does not have a tablet in its hardware lineup, so I understand it feels it has an opportunity to provide an alternative to the iPad. However, I am a bit skeptical about the potential for success. I think Apple may have what little there is of the tablet market sown up with the iPad.</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixel-slate-nocturne-intel-configurations-celeron-m3-i5-i7/">there could be four different models</a> of the Google tablet, no doubt to address different price points. I am interested to see what will be the lowest price for the tablet and how much functionality it will provide.</p>

         	<p>The fact that Kavanaugh will obviously not be “impartial” as an umpire is not surprising and not the real problem. The real problem is that the people supporting Kavanaugh do not want him to be impartial, they want and fully expect him to make decisions along their party ideological lines. Our institutions are reflections of ourselves.</p>

<p>The root cause of this? <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/my_horrible_right_wing_past_confessions_of_a_one_time_religious_right_icon/">White Christian America</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their anti-abortion commitment to evangelicals, and in turn we’d vote for them — by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, “we” would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at at first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for the sake of the above, White Christian America gave up its integrity and moral authority, and it wonders why unaffliated is <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/">the fastest rising religion</a> in the United States.</p>

         	<p>From the Republican’s point of view, the credibility of the Supreme Court and the sanctity of the Constitution is not what is at stake. What is at stake is putting in permanent place Supreme Court justices that support only their ideology.</p>

<p>The simple problem we have is that nobody in positions of Power in this country, be they elected officials, corporations, or oligarchs, are factoring consequences in to their decisions. The only consequence they do fear is not getting their way.</p>

<p>At one point you might have been able to say they these people are simply doing what they thinks is best for the United States and that there can be different approaches toward the same ends. I no longer believe this to be true, the ultimate motivation is staying in power and satisfying the people responsible for that power.</p>

         	<p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub’s performance in last year’s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>

<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer’s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

         	<p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>

<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>

<p>For me the Cub’s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana’s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub’s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer’s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer’s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>

<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don’t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

         	<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>

<p>Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.</p>
