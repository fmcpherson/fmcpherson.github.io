<blockquote>
  <p>The right way for me — as well as the vast majority of the people I have coached over my years as an Evernote consultant — is by using notebooks and stacks as the primary organizing blocks of Evernote, with tags being used not as an organizational tool, but a find feature in Evernote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have used Evernote for a long time, and I use notebooks and stacks as the primary organizational method and tags to help find information. When seek information in Evernote I usually search for that information across all notes unless I expect to only find it in a certain notebook or stack.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.</p>

<p>If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don’t see how in any way that infringes on a person’s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person’s ability to make money on cable TV.</p>

<p>Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being “fair and balanced” is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.</p>
