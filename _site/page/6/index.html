      <div class="e-content"><p>Google Assistant is still flawed by not enabling users to specify unique trigger words for each device. So, I use my smartphone as an alarm clock and I thought it would be cool to enable <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-routines/">the Bedtime routine</a> that turns down the phone, sets an alarm and shuts off lights.</p>

<p>Problem is that routine is enabled for Home and my Pixel phone. So, if I initiate the routine with the two in the same room, Home takes over and then sets the alarm for itself rather than on my phone.</p>

<p>So, I think Google needs to do two things. First, it should provide a way to associate specific routines to specific assistant-enabled devices. Second, it needs to provide a way for users to create trigger words that are specific to devices. Right now, I can squeeze to trigger assistant on my phone and then start the routine, but that requires me to remember this rather than assistant being smart enough to remember for me.</p>

You might say the problem is immaturity, but it is worse than that, the problem is that we have de-valued maturity. Maturity is a life-long process and with it comes the wisdom to know that one does not, cannot, know everything and therefore is open to changing their mind.</p>
