I am now trying the alert part of snooze to see if that works. 
<em>Update: I did find that turning alert on triggers a notification that fires at the time of the snooze. If you go in to Settings, Scheduling, Snoozes and enable Default Alert then I think alerts will be on by default.

<p>While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.  On the other hand, that U processor in the Lenovo is definitely better performing that the Y processor, which Apple choose for the new Macbook Air.</p>

<p>I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering. Food for thought, does anyone have advice on which one to go with?</p>

         	<p>I was on <a href="https://mobiletoday.podbean.com/e/mobileviews-podcast-275-10-year-retrospective/">the MobileViews Podcast</a> this past weekend, and I talked about Google‚Äôs operating systems and commented on how few new operating systems came it to market during the ten years of the podcast.. Chrome OS, first released in 2011, is the newest I‚Äôve used, and even that can be debated because it uses a Linux Kernel.</p>

<p>According to my past weblog posts, <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2009/01/10/giving-palm-its-just-due/">WebOS may be the newest</a> prior to Chrome OS. Android and iOS already existed for a few years.</p>

<p>This is why I am so intrigued by Google‚Äôs work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia">Fuchsia</a>.</p>

         	<p>I decided to renew <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/fmcpherson/">my Flickr Pro</a> account even though I am annoyed by the doubling of the price and being forced to buy two years at a time. I have more than 7000 photos stored in Flickr and several albums that I decided are too valuable for me to lose.</p>

         	<p>Patrick Mahome‚Äôs success during his first NFL season may be more a story more about the sophistication of college football defenses more than anything. There was a time when NFL teams could not start rookie quarterbacks because NFL defenses were too confusing.</p>
