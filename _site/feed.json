			"content_html": "<p>I recently rewrote <a href=\"https://frankm.org\">my profile page</a> and implemented HTTPS using Amazon S3 and Cloudfront.  In my opinion S3 provides one of the easiest and least expensive ways to host a simple, static web site. Unfortunately HTTPS adds complexity, both in what you need to do to build the site and also in how you maintain it.</p>\n\n<p>I did a brief survey and I think that that the simplest way to set up a web site with HTTPS is to host with a service like <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com\">Bluehost</a>, which provides a free SSL certificate. <a href=\"https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/141#shared\">Bluehosts’s $8.99/month price</a> is reasonable, but not as cheap as Amazon for a really small site like mine, which is a single HTML page.</p>\n\n<p>So, in my opinion with the current push to HTTPS,  you are better off going with a service provider that includes HTTPS as part of the service. If you are more technical and willing to fiddle with things, you can save money with S3/Cloudfront.</p>\n",

The big difference is that you can’t associate a custom domain to the free tier, you will have to pay for the VM and it looks like you will need to buy a certificate. The upside to this approach is that you can implement SSL without having to use a CDN.</p>\n",

The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.</p>\n",
