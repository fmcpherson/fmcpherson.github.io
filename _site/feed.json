More thinking and less reacting is needed.</p>\n\n<p>From the author:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Eventually two points occurred to me. The first is that many of our fiercest disputes occur because the people involved simply aren’t thinking: they’re reacting or emoting or virtue-signaling or ingroup-identifying. The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

In the late 70s a fire gutted the building and the owner built a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/uGbj5AdMq6K2\">much smaller “party” store across the U.S. highway from the old site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In its day DeRidders was one of maybe a half dozen grocery stores in my small home town. Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.</p>\n",

Turns out you need to invalidate that page in the Cloudfront console to force it to be refreshed in the cache.
