I personally like a index of post blog posts that I’ve written to make it easier to go back and see my writing at that time. <a href=\"http://reader.smallpicture.com/?opmlurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fh44njkhogn65tpq%2FwebnotesArchive.opml%3Fdl%3D0#\">The software</a> I used in the past made it easy to see those monthly archives, but micro.blog does not. I can create an index using <a href=\"https://fjmnotes.com\">a Wordpress site</a>, but I think I would prefer something built in to micro.blog.  If I were a programmer I suspect the JSON feed would be useful.</p>\n",

I updated my Pi3 with the latest release of Raspbian and then decided to clone my new Jekyll repo and edit <a href=\"https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/about/\">the about page</a> on my Raspberry Pi. Just because I could. I committed and pushed the update to the repo and checked the about page on the new site, and the new edits did not appear. Went to the Netlify site, logged in, and found the deploy failed with some error relating to node. I think during deploy nodejs 8 was attempted to be installed and it failed.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I tried a fresh re-deploy and selected clear cache and this time deployment was successful.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I learned here is that it appears whenever Netlify sees and pulls an update from the repo it seems to rebuild the container/VM that is hosting the site that includes installing nodejs, installing ruby gems (Jekyll uses ruby) then does a Jekyll build and ultimately deploys the site from the site fielder.</p>\n",

			"title": "Long Form Writing and Trying Out Netlify",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/\">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>\n\n<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>\n\n<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href=\"http://writing.frankmcpherson.org\">Let’s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The “broad” push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don’t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>\n\n<p>So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently <a href=\"https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/\">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/pricing/\">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/\">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn’t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>\n\n<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I’ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>\n\n<p>Right now <a href=\"https://writing.frankmcpherson.net\">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>\n",
