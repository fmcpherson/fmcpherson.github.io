Further, the rule is not in any way consistently applied.</p>\n\n<p>Tennis is not “special” because players are on their own, and fans pay good money to watch the players decide that match, not umpires.</p>\n",

It’s about Congress doing it’s job, which is to oversee the executive branch regardless of the party badge of the person holding the office. Oversight must be first, then party goals and not vice versa, that is how the Constitution is structured to enable a functioning government.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why some citizens may be willing to give up the republic for an authoritarian approach they think might be better is because of the ineffectiveness of Congress. Democrats have to remind and convince people that we ought not through out what actually is great about America.</p>\n",

People do certain things because they strongly feel (emotion) they are right.</p>\n\n<p>The word “religion” means to bind, so religious beliefs is a binding together of people with common beliefs, often translated in to emotion driven actions.</p>\n\n<p>Religious and non-religious people have beliefs and emotions, removing religion isn’t going to remove those beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>One can say religion heightens those emotions. It can and has been a method for “getting people worked up” in such a way that emotions are heightened.</p>\n\n<p>Here too there is nothing particularly unique about religion. Dictators and Presidents, atheist and believers, have and will conduct events that heighten emotions.</p>\n\n<p>So, no, removing religious beliefs is not going to decrease or eliminate violence because emotions are part of who we are. Further, there will always be people who know how to manipulate emotions. Mature religion teaches us about our emotions, and helps us to know them and manage them. (Genesis 4:7) Mature religion is the antidote, not the problem.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I don’t get <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html\">the mindset of conservatives</a>. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people’s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.</p>\n\n<p>If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.</p>\n\n<p>Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn’t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.</p>\n",
