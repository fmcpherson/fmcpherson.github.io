Most of these corporations have been profitable for many years, so I doubt they needed the tax cut to increase the wages. And why the need for a public announcement? </p>\n",

I am again finding myself with <a href=\"http://www.toodledo.com\">Toodledo</a>, mostly because it has more filtering features that other apps and because it has a robust web app. However, Toodledo does not have a robust iOS app. </p>\n\n<p>The Toodledo iOS app does the job but doesn’t have the best UI. However, I have found that 2Do syns with Toodledo so I am giving that a try. At worst I can toggle between the two apps because they sync with the same data. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, 2Do does not sync Toodledo’s statuses, so if I want the same functionality I need to create tags rather that statuses. </p>\n",
