First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one’s voice. You don’t have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.</p>\n",

At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>\n\n<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>\n\n<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>\n\n<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>\n",

A Man of Many Parts - The New York Times</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
