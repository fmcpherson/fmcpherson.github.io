We have taken this pathological diversion to a whole other level, to the point where we are able to create impasses that are so acute, they have the appearance of being impossible to transform out of. And I wonder sometimes, when we sit in our disintegrated state, if we want to move from the impasse. The impasse itself has become like a nice comfy couch to curl up on”</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com\">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web’s permanence, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>\n\n<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html\">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>\n\n<p>To Dave’s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>\n\n<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>\n",
