			"content_html": "<p>A few weeks ago I read <a href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.</p>\n\n<p>Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from ‚Äúregular‚Äù web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.</p>\n\n<p>The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by ‚Äúthe garden.‚Äù With that paradigm, I created two ‚Äúprojects‚Äù, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about <a href=\"https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html\">which Chromebook I was going to buy</a> and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording <a href=\"https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html\">my experience with using the Pixelbook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why <a href=\"http://testing.frankmcpherson.net\">I have been dabbling with wikis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.</p>\n",

There appears to be a problem recovering from the new ‚Äúdeep sleep‚Äù / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this ‚Äúfeature?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I‚Äôve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.</p>\n",
