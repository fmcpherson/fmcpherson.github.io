IMHO the major impediment is iOS’ lack of support for Bluetooth mice.</p>\n\n<p>I think if Apple wanted to, they could take a cue from Google’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/\">Project Crostini</a> to add containerized desktop app support to iOS. The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished. Containers come close to this idea.</p>\n",
