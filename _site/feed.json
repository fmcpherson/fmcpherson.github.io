I am now trying the alert part of snooze to see if that works. \n<em>Update: I did find that turning alert on triggers a notification that fires at the time of the snooze. If you go in to Settings, Scheduling, Snoozes and enable Default Alert then I think alerts will be on by default. If there is something important I will either dump in to Reminders or Noteplan.</em></p>\n",
