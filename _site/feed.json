To me, a blog, is a blog, but there are titleless posts and posts with titles. Blogging back in 1999 was oriented around dates, and a weblog was a log of what one saw and reacted to on the web on a particular date. (In otherwords, titleless posts.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I do get the idea of <a href=\"https://kfitz.info/feeds-and-gardens/\">coherent interaction relating to a blog post</a> that is probably the real, special sauce, to micro.blog. Back in 1999 we tried to implement this concept through link backs, but that had the challenge of notification of when someone did a link back so that you can participate in the “conversation.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Webmentions</a> may be a better technlogical implementation of the link back concept. Ironic that the micro.blog blog doesn’t seem to support it.</p>\n\n<p>Again, being honest, I don’t write what I write on my blogs for the comments or the likes or the shares. I selfishly write for me, and if you the reader get value out of what I write, all the better.</p>\n",

I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.</p>\n\n<p>One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000’s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today’s on-screen keyboards.</p>\n\n<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/\">printed in a magazine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.</p>\n",
