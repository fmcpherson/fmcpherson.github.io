Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free. </p>\n\n<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi\">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word “sin” with “debt” more often.</p>\n",
