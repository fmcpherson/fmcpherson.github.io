While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.</p>\n\n<p>I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering.</p>\n",

The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished.
