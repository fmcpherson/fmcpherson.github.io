Gmail also does not have a button to snooze a message, but at least you can configure one of the two swipe actions to snooze.</p>\n\n<p>Ack! Just realize that when I implemented categories (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums) in the Gmail app on my phone, that changes the web version of Gmail too. Worse, there is no single button way to archive all email of a category. You first have to select all messages and then buttons appear to mark read, archive, delete, etc..</p>\n\n<p>So, Google, give me an easy way to archive all email in a category in Gmail and I will be unaffected by the demise of Inbox. Think about how fast it is to triage email in Inbox and enable that same capability in Gmail.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com\">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web’s permanence, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>\n\n<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html\">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>\n\n<p>To Dave’s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>\n\n<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>\n",

Believing that Newton told us the truth about how the world works, we modeled our institutions on atomistic principles.\n…\nOur “God view” came to resemble our worldview. In this century, even much of our practical theology has also become mechanical and atomistic. Walk into many churches and you will hear God described as a being who behaves almost as predictably as Newton’s universe. Say you believe in God and you will be saved.  Sin against God and you will be condemned. Say you are sorry and you will be forgiven.  Obey the law and you will be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
