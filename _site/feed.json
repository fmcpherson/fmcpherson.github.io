When I was growing up the nearest grocery store, one of these corner stores, was DeRidders. In the late 70s a fire gutted the building and the owner built a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/uGbj5AdMq6K2\">much smaller “party” store across the U.S. highway from the old site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In its day DeRidders was one of maybe a half dozen grocery stores in my small home town. Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.</p>\n",

Turns out you need to invalidate that page in the Cloudfront console to force it to be refreshed in the cache. Along the way I made changes to the TTL for the page.</p>\n\n<p>All fun geeky stuff, but really too many hoops to serve a simple web page with one picture.</p>\n",
