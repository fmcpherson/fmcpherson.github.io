It did the job and probably will do so for a while until Amazon changes their API. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I did not see <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ipad-diaries/ipad-diaries-transmit-replacements-and-ftp-clients/\">this article on Macstories about alternatives to Transmit</a> and in particular iFiles, which is cheaper and may do the job just as well. </p>\n",
