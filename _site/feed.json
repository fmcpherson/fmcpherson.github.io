Now I have to go and figure out how get that bucket, which is hosting my <a href=\"http://frankm.org\">personal profile</a> set up with HTTPS.

Every time I post something here I was getting error messages from Github. So, this afternoon I’ve been trying to fix the problem, deciding to just remove all the contents in Github and start over.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, now that I have removed everything, and even generated a new access token, nothing is transferring from here to there. I don’t know whether I broke something over perhaps exceeded some time of commit limit on a public repo.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if I can put it into a new repo?</p>\n",
