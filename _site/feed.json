You type a character and wait, I did you not, ten seconds, for it to appear on the screen and the cursor to move. How can Microsoft, in 2017, produce such a horribly performing test? Do they not even test these things? </p>\n",

The country, and what most will accept is much different now than during Watergate. I doubt we will ever see a Republican tell Trump he should resign as he is sure to be impeached. </p>\n",

Before Day One changed to a yearly subscription, I had purchased a version and therfore I am grandfathered in a plan that enables me to sync across iOS devices, but that will not support Android. So, is it worth $25 per year to have access to my journal from my Android smartphone? </p>\n",

I have three days to pick up the package otherwise it will be returned for refund.
