I also think it is an iterative improvement on Oreo, meaning that if you don’t have It you aren’t necessarily missing out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/24/every-new-android-p-feature-weve-found-far-continuously-updated/\">Android Police has a complete rundown</a> of all the new things. Oddly, my favorite may be the charging sound, as I have had cases when I thought I was charging my phone when I wasn’t because the charger was completely plugged in.  The cleaned up settings and notifications are nice, and the navigation improvements are ok but not amazing. I am still looking for significant improvement in battery life.</p>\n",

If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.</p>\n\n<p>One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.</p>\n",

Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don’t really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.</p>\n",
