The following statement says to me, “I am not to blame, but since I am the President I am the scapegoat.” MSU Alumni, parents, and students ought to be appalled by what appears to be institutionalized problems.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
