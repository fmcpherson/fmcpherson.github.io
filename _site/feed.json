It would be nice to see a video of the changes, but apparently that has not been provided by Google.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been running the new version of Google Fit for four days, and I am pretty happy with the change. I had already made the mental shift from steps to move minutes. Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days.</p>\n\n<p>One problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case. I’ve had several occurrences of the battery running out on my watch by early evening, which was not an issue in the past.</p>\n",

However, while it may be a slight nit, I think the two views of America has been liberty versus equality.</p>\n\n<p>The Declaration of Independence is an aspiration statement of all men being equal, although we know that black men where not considered men at that time. Nor were women considered equal with men. The United States was written to define and contain our government and therefore maintain our liberty.</p>\n\n<p>Over the centuries we have been striving towards the aspiration of the Declaration but clearly not all people are on board. Some would say the push for true equality is impinging on their liberty.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the thing…we think liberty is about our government, but on its own it says nothing about what one does with that liberty. Some will claim it makes them free to do whatever they want, while others will say it makes us free to make the best society for everyone.</p>\n",

Markdown is a markup language and by definition markup is used for presentation or publishing content.</p>\n\n<p>Markdown makes sense for indicating how you want writing to appear in a published format like a web page or a document. But, do I really need markdown for raw text-based notes that I really am not going to publish? For me marked up content is harder to read.</p>\n\n<p>An example of where I see markdown being used the wrong way is in Noteplan. I can markup my notes for <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> but I don’t just see the rendered result I see the markup, asterisks and underlines AND the bold and italic that that is harder for me to read.</p>\n",
