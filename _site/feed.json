			"content_html": "<p>I don’t understand the fixation with creating note taking applications that support markdown. Markdown is a markup language and by definition markup is used for presentation or publishing content.</p>\n\n<p>Markdown makes sense for indicating how you want writing to appear in a published format like a web page or a document. But, do I really need markdown for raw text-based notes that I really am not going to publish? For me marked up content is harder to read.</p>\n\n<p>An example of where I see markdown being used the wrong way is in Noteplan. I can markup my notes for <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> but I don’t just see the rendered result I see the markup, asterisks and underlines AND the bold and italic that that is harder for me to read.</p>\n",

I use Google Fit to track my walking. My issues with it are less to do with the apps and more to do with the data.</p>\n\n<p>It is not obvious how to download your fitness data and Google doesn’t really provide much in the way of analyzing data. When looking at data like this you want to see trends so you can answer questions like, did I walk more than last week? Did I walk more than last month? Last year? Improvement is measured over time not in a point of time. It is shocking to me that a company that bills itself as data driven is does not provide much, if anything, for analyzing this data.</p>\n",
