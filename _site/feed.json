The case is not one of the custom design options, so there is no really good reason why it has taken this long for Google to ship to me a simple case. Particularly when the originating location is Chicago and I am in Detroit.</p>\n",

I think it shows that while the physical performance (clock speed) is nearly the same, newer chips perform better due to all the parallel processing occuring within the chip. </p>\n",
