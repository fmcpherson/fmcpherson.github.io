Jesus _is _the Christ which means all that God is, is given to us in Jesus, rendering a new understanding of God as relational, self-communicative, self-emptying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.omegacenter.info/reply-to-richard-rohr-cosmic-christ/\">A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center</a></p>\n",

I don’t often type with a keyboard on my lap. If I were to attend a meeting or conference I rather use a stylus and hand write notes.</p>\n",

I am finding writing it frustratingly slow to write on the Surface 3, and I would not have said that before having used the iPad Pro/Pencil for a year.</p>\n",

I’ve found that for me it is the best way to maintain a “Now” page of things I am currently working on or researching.</p>\n\n<p>As a topic comes up, I got to <a href=\"http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/now\">the Now page</a> and create a wiki link to the topic, which I then click to create a new page to which I start adding content.</p>\n\n<p>What I need to determine is what to do with the topics that I complete. I think the ideal solution is a plugin that automatically generates an index of all pages in my wiki so that even when I remove the wiki link in the Now page, a link to the page remains somewhere so that it can be found later. I could manually build an index, but in this day and age I would think an automated approach would be possible and best.</p>\n",
