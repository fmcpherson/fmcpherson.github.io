Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free. </p>\n\n<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi\">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word “sin” with “debt” more often.</p>\n",

I am regretting following the instructions literally, meaning I installed the Pi Zero in the case and there isn’t an easy way to remove the micro SD card without removing them Zero entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://frankmcpherson.blog/uploads/2017/8ce60d791a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",
