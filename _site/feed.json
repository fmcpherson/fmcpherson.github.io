All of the infrastructure upon which the web runs is owned by corporations. The technology upon which the web is built is intended to be open, but they are under control of corporations.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations pushed the web towards HTML5 in support of apps that they utlimately control. Corporations own the browsers that we use and with coding changes can force all of use towards a direction they want. The network infrastructure upon which the packets ride are owned by corporations who can, and have, allowed governments to capture and review those packets.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can host content on a web server running in your house. What happens when Comcast or AT&amp;T decides to not sell Internet access to you? What happens when the coporations that control DNS remove your domain from their servers, or direct requests somewhere else?</p>\n\n<p>None of this is truly open. All of it is at risk if it does not serve coporate interests. Right now the best we have are degrees of openness.</p>\n",

First, I note that all reviews are of the high-end, 8 GB model. Second, I can’t help but feel that everyone is desperate for a competitor to the iPad and therefore will praise up any attempt.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think the main issue is price. At a minimum Microsoft should be bundling the keyboard with the device at the price of that $650 price. I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand. If you just consume content you can live without the keyboard and stylus.</p>\n",

A similar 1908 editorial in the Leavenworth, Kansas, Times, again invoking “American dreams,” championed “the equitable distribution of wealth” while making pointed note of the vast discrepancy between the pay of an insurance-company executive and a headmaster: “Why do we accord highest place to money mongers and lowest place to teachers of ideals?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

If I make edits, like I just did (you will notice a typo in the related tweet) the corresponding syndicated item is not changed. I think this highlights one of the main differences between blogs and social networks. Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.</p>\n\n<p>One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new.

Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don’t really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.</p>\n",
