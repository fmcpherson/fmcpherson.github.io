One thing that I do think might be helpful is to point out that every president has issues with the press, they likely can produce past video of democrat and republican presidents taking issue with them.</p>\n\n<p>And here is the thing, in this context, <strong>the President of the United States is not “the people.”</strong> Consequently, a press that does NOT explicitly agree with the President is NOT an enemy of the people, if anything they may be an enemy of the President.</p>\n\n<p>Trump promotes the idea that he is just “one of us.” He, like all Presidents before him, is not just one of us.</p>\n\n<p>The President serves us, and the Congress, the Supreme Court and yes, the Press, are the institutions identified by the founders of our country as being responsible to make sure the President serves faithfully by upholding his oath. By definition this means that when a person takes the oath of President of the United States, that person ceases being just one of us.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog\">my blog</a>. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankm\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank\">Facebook</a>, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more “professional.”</p>\n\n<p>Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don’t make sense for those audiences.</p>\n\n<p>I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it’s a write once experience meaning that edits don’t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn’t a mechanism to do so.</p>\n",

All of the infrastructure upon which the web runs is owned by corporations. The technology upon which the web is built is intended to be open, but they are under control of corporations.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations pushed the web towards HTML5 in support of apps that they utlimately control. Corporations own the browsers that we use and with coding changes can force all of use towards a direction they want. The network infrastructure upon which the packets ride are owned by corporations who can, and have, allowed governments to capture and review those packets.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can host content on a web server running in your house. What happens when Comcast or AT&amp;T decides to not sell Internet access to you? What happens when the coporations that control DNS remove your domain from their servers, or direct requests somewhere else?</p>\n\n<p>None of this is truly open. All of it is at risk if it does not serve coporate interests. Right now the best we have are degrees of openness.</p>\n",

I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand.
