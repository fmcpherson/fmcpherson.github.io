Next, I downloaded the CSS and uploaded a copy to my server. Then, I experimented with the <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp\">@media</a> setting, landing on auto for the left and right margins and max-device-width to 1024px. </p>\n\n<p>Now the home page renders centered on my iPad Mini, Nexus 9 and iPad Pro. It actually renders the best on the Nexus 9. </p>\n",
