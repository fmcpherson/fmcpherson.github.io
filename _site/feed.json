Right now I use <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/termius/id549039908?mt=8\">Termius</a>, but it does this thing where it doesn’t scroll properly as the screen fills up so I have to do some dragging around to re-align the display. I also am turned off by the $29/year subscription cost and there are some premium features I wouldn’t mind having. It is, however, the most recently updated app in the store.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webssh-pro/id497714887?mt=8\">WebSSH Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt-2/id917437289?mt=8\">Prompt 2</a> are two other alternatives that appear at the top of a Google search. </p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I got an email from Amazon telling me that I can use an Amazon Locker to receive items shipped to me. There is a Whole Foods near me that has a locker, so I can select it as a delivery location. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?node=6442600011\">How do I use it?</a></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, when something I ordered is delivered to the locker, I will get an email with a six digit code that I then use at the locker location to retrieve my package. I have three days to pick up the package otherwise it will be returned for refund. Perhaps best of all, lockers can be used as a drop off location for returns.</p>\n\n<p>Given the rise in people having deliveries stolen, I can see these lockers becoming useful for valuable items being shipped for which you may not be hope to sign for.</p>\n",
