         	<p>One thing lacking is discourse and the desire to find lasting solutions to problems. There is a difference in a dogmatic view to problems, by which I mean a view in which solutions are pre-determined and implemented no matter what, and a scientific view that presents ideas (hypothesis) that are proven not to be false.</p>

<p>The key element to an hypothesis, or an idea, is the opennes to it being wrong.</p>

The idea of cutting taxes will result in more jobs and higher wages is a myth. Corporations are hyper-optimized for shareholder return, which is done by cutting jobs and maintaining or lowering wages.</p>

<p>In almost all areas in the United States, mistakes are being made on the fundamentals. If the premise upon which a decision is based is wrong, then the decision and its consequences are wrong.</p>

<p>The foundation is cracking, and nobody is willing to face up to this reality.</p>

         	<p>While I am at it, despite that I use <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, I have to confess that I don’t “get” micro.blogs. Perhaps I am being too literal. To me, a blog, is a blog, but there are titleless posts and posts with titles. Blogging back in 1999 was oriented around dates, and a weblog was a log of what one saw and reacted to on the web on a particular date. (In otherwords, titleless posts.)</p>

<p>Now, I do get the idea of <a href="https://kfitz.info/feeds-and-gardens/">coherent interaction relating to a blog post</a> that is probably the real, special sauce, to micro.blog. Back in 1999 we tried to implement this concept through link backs, but that had the challenge of notification of when someone did a link back so that you can participate in the “conversation.”</p>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a> may be a better technlogical implementation of the link back concept. Ironic that the micro.blog blog doesn’t seem to support it.</p>

<p>Again, being honest, I don’t write what I write on my blogs for the comments or the likes or the shares. I selfishly write for me, and if you the reader get value out of what I write, all the better.</p>

         	<p>I guess that I am getting old, I don’t get microcasts. For my ears, podcasts can be too long AND too short. Something that you say in two minutes can be written. Printed words, on the web, is the primary way I consume information. Audio adds anothe format requiring additional hardware. I recognize that I may be exhibiting how I have been programmed by media companies all these years.</p>

         	<p>My first computer was the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html">Timex Sinclair</a> 1000 that my grandmother gave me as a birthday present in 1983. I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.</p>

<p>One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000’s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today’s on-screen keyboards.</p>

<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed in a magazine</a>.</p>

<p>The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.</p>

<p>I have mixed feeling about this news. As time has past I have accepted the series is done and moved on. In some ways it would be nice to leave it be. On the other hand, knowing Joss is behind this has me curious to see where he takes the story. I think Joss is smart enough to know a reboot cannot try to be the same. In the meantime, lots can happen for this to not happen.</p>
