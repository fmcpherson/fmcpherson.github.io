Current politics makes the problem worse. Not enough people took competency seriously enough and we are starting to pay the price.</p>

<p>The problem is that too many people confuse politics with competency, by which I mean they don’t think Trump is incompetent they just think Democrats and Republicans are simply preventing him from doing the job.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Founding Fathers were not unaware of the possibility that a demagogue or a knave might win the presidency. That’s why they checked the executive with an independent Congress and built in powers of impeachment. That Republicans in this Congress have proven so subservient to — or scared of — Trump that they have let the fate of the country hinge on whether his staff can adequately distract and calm him is a subversion of the constitutional order and an abdication of responsibility.</p>

         	<p>To further reinforce <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/09/05/145541.html">the point I made earlier</a> that the Democrat strategy this fall ought to be focus on Congress’ constitutional role, I refer to you <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/populist-leaders-and-the-defiance-of-norms/">this written by Alan Jacobs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Norms are created by institutions, and we live in an age of weak and despised institutions. This is how populist leaders arise: when a great many people believe that institutions exist merely to serve themselves, they come to despise not just those institutions but also the norms associated with them, and applaud leaders who scorn and seek to tear down the whole edifice.</p>

         	<p>I agree with <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/03/154301.html">Dave’s high level plan</a>, for the Democrat strategy this fall. It’s about Congress doing it’s job, which is to oversee the executive branch regardless of the party badge of the person holding the office. Oversight must be first, then party goals and not vice versa, that is how the Constitution is structured to enable a functioning government.</p>

<p>The reason why some citizens may be willing to give up the republic for an authoritarian approach they think might be better is because of the ineffectiveness of Congress. Democrats have to remind and convince people that we ought not through out what actually is great about America.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/opinion/tn-blr-me-intheory-20180904-story.html">In Theory: Does religious belief make the world more violent?</a></p>

<p>Understanding of the above question and a good answer require contemplation on the words  “religious beliefs.”</p>

<p>Beliefs most often translate into emotionally driven actions. People do certain things because they strongly feel (emotion) they are right.</p>

<p>The word “religion” means to bind, so religious beliefs is a binding together of people with common beliefs, often translated in to emotion driven actions.</p>

<p>Religious and non-religious people have beliefs and emotions, removing religion isn’t going to remove those beliefs.</p>

<p>One can say religion heightens those emotions. It can and has been a method for “getting people worked up” in such a way that emotions are heightened.</p>

<p>Here too there is nothing particularly unique about religion. Dictators and Presidents, atheist and believers, have and will conduct events that heighten emotions.</p>

<p>So, no, removing religious beliefs is not going to decrease or eliminate violence because emotions are part of who we are. Further, there will always be people who know how to manipulate emotions. Mature religion teaches us about our emotions, and helps us to know them and manage them. (Genesis 4:7) Mature religion is the antidote, not the problem.</p>

         	<p>I host an application on Amazon Lightsail, and I originally provisioned the then lowest priced instance, which cost $5 per month for 1 vCPU and 512 MB of RAM.</p>

<p>Two months ago I determined the app needed more memory, so I decided it worth upgrading to the $10 per month, 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM plan.</p>

<p>Last month Amazon released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?fl=sp2">new monthly pricing</a> that lowered the price of the 1 vCPU and 1 GB instance to $5 per month.</p>

<p>Cloud computing is the one thing that I use where the cost truly decreases over time and it just happens. I did not know about the change in pricing until I got the bill for last month and saw it was lower.</p>

         	<p>I don’t get <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html">the mindset of conservatives</a>. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people’s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.</p>

<p>If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.</p>

<p>Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.</p>

<p>Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.</p>

<p>Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn’t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?</p>

<p>P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.</p>

         	<p>Apparently Google announced they will be releasing a new version of Wear OS within the next month. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-wear-os-updates-hint-at-fitness-smartwatches-to-come/">Articles are available</a> from several sources, all appearing pretty much the same. It would be nice to see a video of the changes, but apparently that has not been provided by Google.</p>

<p>I’ve been running the new version of Google Fit for four days, and I am pretty happy with the change. I had already made the mental shift from steps to move minutes. Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days.</p>

<p>One problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case. I’ve had several occurrences of the battery running out on my watch by early evening, which was not an issue in the past.</p>
