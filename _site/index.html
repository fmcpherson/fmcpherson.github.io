         	<p>My first computer was the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html">Timex Sinclair</a> 1000 that my grandmother gave me as a birthday present in 1983. I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.</p>

<p>One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000’s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today’s on-screen keyboards.</p>

<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed in a magazine</a>.</p>

<p>The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.</p>

<p>I have mixed feeling about this news. As time has past I have accepted the series is done and moved on. In some ways it would be nice to leave it be. On the other hand, knowing Joss is behind this has me curious to see where he takes the story. I think Joss is smart enough to know a reboot cannot try to be the same. In the meantime, lots can happen for this to not happen.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I recently rewrote <a href="https://frankm.org">my profile page</a> and implemented HTTPS using Amazon S3 and Cloudfront.  In my opinion S3 provides one of the easiest and least expensive ways to host a simple, static web site. Unfortunately HTTPS adds complexity, both in what you need to do to build the site and also in how you maintain it.</p>

<p>I did a brief survey and I think that that the simplest way to set up a web site with HTTPS is to host with a service like <a href="https://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a>, which provides a free SSL certificate. <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/141#shared">Bluehosts’s $8.99/month price</a> is reasonable, but not as cheap as Amazon for a really small site like mine, which is a single HTML page.</p>

<p>So, in my opinion with the current push to HTTPS,  you are better off going with a service provider that includes HTTPS as part of the service. If you are more technical and willing to fiddle with things, you can save money with S3/Cloudfront.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html">Azure has a different approach to static sites</a> because it associates a VM to the site rather than storage. The big difference is that you can’t associate a custom domain to the free tier, you will have to pay for the VM and it looks like you will need to buy a certificate. The upside to this approach is that you can implement SSL without having to use a CDN.</p>

         	<p>When I first saw the title of this book, <a href="http://howtothinkbook.com/">How to Think</a>, my reaction was, “do we really need to teach people how to think?” Then I thought, yes, yes we do! More thinking and less reacting is needed.</p>

<p>From the author:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Eventually two points occurred to me. The first is that many of our fiercest disputes occur because the people involved simply aren’t thinking: they’re reacting or emoting or virtue-signaling or ingroup-identifying. The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think.”</p>
