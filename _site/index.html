With previous posts I published from Ulysses I did not enable markdown in the publishing dialog and therefore the publisher converted the markdown to HTML so it appeared correct in Wordpress. In the previous post I enabled markdown, and since Wordpress was not configured to use markdown it did not render properly. So, to have enabled markdown in the writing settings of the WP-Admin console, which fixed the problem.</p>

<p>In other words…. operator error! :)</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don’t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.</p>

<p>The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.</p>

<p>Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don’t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I like Drafts, but I think the concept behind it is nonsensical. The idea of Drafts is that you use it to write and edit any text that you can then send to other apps, which also have the capability to write and edit text. So, you see “actions” in Drafts for entering tasks in apps like OmniFocus and Todoist, but why is that easier than just entering information in Microblog, OmniFocus and Todoist? It seems to me that people who use iOS for productivity are so enamored by the workflows they have created they don’t seem to realize the workflows are basically workarounds for deficiencies that existed in previous versions of iOS.</p>

<p>I am finding the number of iOS apps that basically do the same thing insane! Really, how many markdown editors are needed?</p>
