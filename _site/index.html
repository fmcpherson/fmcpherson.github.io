		<h1><a href="/2018/05/29/tolerance-is-fundamental.html">Tolerance Is Fundamental To Freedom</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.</p>

<p>You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.</p>

<p>Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.</p>

<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">The Bill Gates Line</a></p>

<p>Do all platforms ultimately end up being commoditized? I see companies like Google and Facebook striving to not be like the personal computer or Windows, so I suspect they choose to be aggregators to protect themselves.</p>

<p>I am surprised that few, if any, reviews of notes apps like Bear don’t address security.  Can you encrypt the content you put in the app? How easy is that encryption? Can you encrypt entire notes? Notebooks? Or just snippets of text? And who holds the keys?</p>

<p>I am thinking if Chromebook manufacturers expect people to be using Linux apps, wouldn’t they provide storage options greater than 64 GB? I find the news about Linux support on Chromebooks intriguing enough for me to consider purchasing a new one once the feature is widely available.</p>

<p>In a democracy the leader does not dictate behavior, that is called dictatorship. The fact that Trump does not get the fundamentals of democracy is scary, and the fact that we elected such a person President is very disappointing. The fact that so many people do not see this as an issue is frightening, and a sign that our democracy may already be lost.</p>

Once that feature is seen in the code you might as well let the broad developer community in on the fun.</p>

<p>The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited. Right now I can only think one app I will want to run in such a container and that is <a href="https://standardnotes.org">Standard Notes</a>.</p>
