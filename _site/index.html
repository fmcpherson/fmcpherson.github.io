      <div class="e-content"><p>I like Drafts, but I think the concept behind it is nonsensical. The idea of Drafts is that you use it to write and edit any text that you can then send to other apps, which also have the capability to write and edit text. So, you see “actions” in Drafts for entering tasks in apps like OmniFocus and Todoist, but why is that easier than just entering information in Microblog, OmniFocus and Todoist? It seems to me that people who use iOS for productivity are so enamored by the workflows they have created they don’t seem to realize the workflows are basically workarounds for deficiencies that existed in previous versions of iOS.</p>

<p>I am finding the number of iOS apps that basically do the same thing insane! Really, how many markdown editors are needed?</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.</p>

<p>You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.</p>

<p>Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.</p>

<p>Do all platforms ultimately end up being commoditized? I see companies like Google and Facebook striving to not be like the personal computer or Windows, so I suspect they choose to be aggregators to protect themselves.</p>
