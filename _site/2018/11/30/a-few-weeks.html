	<p>A few weeks ago I read <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>

<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.</p>

<p>Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from “regular” web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.</p>

<p>And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.</p>

<p>The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by “the garden.” With that paradigm, I created two “projects”, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">which Chromebook I was going to buy</a> and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html">my experience with using the Pixelbook</a>.</p>

<p>In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why <a href="http://testing.frankmcpherson.net">I have been dabbling with wikis</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.</p>
