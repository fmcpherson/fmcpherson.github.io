  <article class="post-content e-content">
	<p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>

<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>

<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">Let’s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The “broad” push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href="http://1999.io">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don’t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>

<p>So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn’t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>

<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I’ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>
